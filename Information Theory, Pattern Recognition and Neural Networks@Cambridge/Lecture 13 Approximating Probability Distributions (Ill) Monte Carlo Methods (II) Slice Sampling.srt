1
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:12,288
Let's recap where we're up to in the course and what relevant reading in the text

2
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:13,312
Book

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:20,224
We've done a lot of information Theory data compression and when I went to the inference and data modeling

4
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,064
The relevant chapters

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,648
7 haircut

6
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:30,976
What color method 91352

7
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:34,560
But I still message coming up in the next chapter 33

8
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:36,864
I'd like to highlight some additional reading

9
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,728
Whitcomb's material we wasn't doing lectures but it's a good thing to do

10
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:46,336
I encourage you to read a very short chapter cold

11
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:50,176
And in order to understand this life and the next one

12
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:56,064
You may want to read about icing models in you want if you're not already familiar with them

13
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:02,976
Isn't that whole bunch of recommended exercise is on the website and some of some of them are on the screen

14
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:07,072
Now you may enjoy doing that if I said anything you want

15
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:10,656
Fully understand Imperial then doing the exercises is a

16
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,936
Kipapa School

17
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:16,032
The course website the books website is there

18
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,640
We're in the middle of talking about Monte Carlo methods

19
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,224
In the last lecture we introduced some

20
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,552
Basic standard Monte Carlo methods

21
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:32,416
And the rules of the game that we are interested in

22
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:35,488
Red distribution copay

23
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:38,048
It's rats cuz it's a bit nasty

24
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,096
It's not

25
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:43,168
We can compute it

26
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:47,520
So we can write it as Ethan the lineup

27
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:50,592
On Zed and we have computer program

28
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,920
Evaluate this thing for any

29
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:57,504
Value of XX being a certified diamond small thing

30
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:00,320
These properties were interested in under the sister Beach

31
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,368
So the rules of the game

32
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,672
They can evaluate

33
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:14,400
But not that we don't know that cuz that would be of interest to be like

34
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:19,520
Want to know that we often give up on his head because it's so hot

35
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:25,408
On the problems with

36
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:29,760
Problem one says give me some samples

37
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:36,160
Repeat

38
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:43,328
Either by phone or in some other way please tell me the expected value of some functions I'm interested in

39
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:46,656
Under anesthesia red distribution

40
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,960
Average value of pi

41
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,264
Because some function I'm interested in

42
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:59,712
Not the average under the Nazi rest distribution of the function

43
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,272
Disable touch functions pie

44
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,832
You all

45
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,880
We can use

46
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:13,536
Solutions to problem want to answer problem too because we can just died his intestine

47
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,840
Mesa all

48
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:19,424
Expected value we can estimate

49
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:26,336
That's by summing up by

50
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:31,968
I hope that you got from the distribution empirical average of cost

51
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:37,600
Boy abusing

52
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:44,768
Sometimes today the nasty red distribution will be the fee

53
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:51,168
Spin systems are one example I mentioned in the last night. Maybe were interested in

54
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:51,936
Magnets

55
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:57,056
And we have a spin system with an energy

56
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:01,152
That depends on the couplings J

57
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:12,928
The Energy System the energy of a system is

58
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,976
The sum of a loader

59
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,631
Weighted

60
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:26,751
Truck X between Pairs of spins

61
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:32,127
And the mail also be local Fields H and HIV

62
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,735
Pale skins and there is

63
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:43,903
An n-dimensional binary that

64
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:50,815
But that's an example of a problem we want to focus all the sort of things you might want to know

65
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:57,215
But you're not a magnet what is its average energy

66
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:03,615
Fluctuations in its energy with you can get if you know the mean squared energy I mean honestly what this mean

67
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:09,247
Magnetisation which is the average of the spindle

68
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,807
Maybe mean squared

69
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,343
Magnetisation

70
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:19,743
Andrew might be interested in the entropy which which is the average

71
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,303
Log on everything

72
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:28,191
A bunch of things we might want tonight

73
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:34,847
Hernando magnet and you probably won't want to know all of those out of range of temperature so I can pop in it

74
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,383
Domino's Pizza

75
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,783
Like this and then recall

76
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:49,183
The inverse temperature Pizza is inverse temperature

77
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:54,047
So those are examples of things you might want to know

78
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:03,519
And I emphasize last time when we do Monte Carlo message we are not trying to find BMO

79
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:07,359
Most probable State offices

80
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,783
We would only be completely doing that if we set the temperature

81
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,903
Body cold then it will hopefully be fine

82
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:26,303
The Golem

83
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,607
A few samples

84
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,887
Look like

85
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:36,287
I'm going to try to visit the whole of it

86
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,591
The number of electrons in the universe

87
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,895
Embrace preferring lost power

88
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:48,319
Okay so that's the rules of the game and an example of what we doing last time

89
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,391
We discussed importance sampling rejection sampling

90
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:55,231
Get something on the Metropolis method

91
00:06:55,487 --> 00:07:01,631
Metropolis method is actually a very general cancel because many of the other methods are examples

92
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:08,031
When I say the Metropolis message today I'm quite helping using a push or pull

93
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:12,383
Publix method with a simple proposal Distribution off the Titan High code

94
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,943
And the little

95
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,551
Let's repeat that little show now just to remind you what we were doing

96
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:25,695
So we have a nephew probability distribution in red and have functions whose average values

97
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,487
You're interested in

98
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:37,727
We looked at simple sampling from a uniform distribution and then we wait

99
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:44,127
Taking Point sampling distribution

100
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:50,527
No problem turning green the Easy distribution cute then you rewrite the point

101
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,319
Sampling Yuri weight

102
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,367
The five values

103
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:58,207
To take account of having used the wrong distribution

104
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:02,047
And we did that for a variety of distribution cookies

105
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,863
Then we

106
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:11,263
Rejection sampling which is a perfectly sampling from the red distribution by throwing away

107
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,847
Some of the samples from the green distribution

108
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,407
And rejection sampling

109
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,967
Doesn't work if you do it wrong

110
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:23,039
Nickel / dimensions

111
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,063
But it

112
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:29,439
Open Bible technique in small numbers of dimensions

113
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:35,839
And there are high dimensional methods which can use rejection sampling

114
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,631
Opponents to make them go

115
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:41,471
Something being used in one dimension as a Time

116
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:45,055
Then we go down to the Metropolis message

117
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,639
And my examples of metropolis message was that

118
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:52,479
Have a continuous space and the Nazi distribution is turning red

119
00:08:54,015 --> 00:09:00,159
We introduced a green distribution which varies with the current states whatever your current state is required

120
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:06,559
For example

121
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:10,399
Properties of the red it doesn't have to be

122
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:16,799
So you pick any Q you want and then there's a rule when you grew up and let you but either accept thing

123
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:19,103
Florida get a proposal

124
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,639
I'm retarded around

125
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:32,671
The rejection lead to point piling up in the places where it is think so

126
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:35,487
Green distributions

127
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:38,815
Projections for the strength

128
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,351
Come Sunday

129
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,631
Bread distribution

130
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:48,287
And there's a fair that almost any greened recent Q

131
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,199
Will Givens

132
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,479
Long running time

133
00:09:56,735 --> 00:10:00,319
Give you a sign for what Auntie comes from

134
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,111
Feed the thread distribution

135
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:09,279
Asymptotic time could be extremely long if you've made a poor choice of

136
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:19,775
I also showed you get something I wasn't recap for the kids that are now

137
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,871
But that's a little bit rock and roll

138
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:28,479
Updating one variable at a time from its conditional distribution

139
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:31,295
To get something nice property

140
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:35,135
But it doesn't have any parameters in it unlike

141
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,951
The public

142
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:43,583
That pickup

143
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,887
And that might be questioned important

144
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:52,287
Get something is not it doesn't mean to get something but at least you don't have to chew

145
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,103
Okay

146
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,663
What we're going to do now is

147
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:03,551
Focus in a bit Home Depot

148
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:09,695
And we're going to criticize it we are motivated to do the advice

149
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,487
So

150
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:19,679
Here are the problems with the standard most especially the Metropolis

151
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:26,079
But it gets around by random Walk and Run the books can be very slow

152
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,615
Second

153
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,919
Chocolate method I showed you

154
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:34,271
Hyukoh Stepside to it and the results that you got very sensitive

155
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:39,647
To the choice of steps I didn't choose honeysett size

156
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:46,047
If you use two biggest that side then typically you'll get nowhere very slowly

157
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,583
So

158
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,447
You have to choose exactly and it would be great for the scaffold training

159
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,495
How to get good results

160
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,287
Finally

161
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:03,199
I told you I said that's a synthetic leave this thing will converge but there's no way of telling that they send a message

162
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:08,575
Well how they can book you can run a whole letter Diagnostics that you really don't get any guarantee of confession

163
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:12,159
I'm going to look at Solutions of all three of these

164
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,951
Problems today

165
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:20,351
Behavior

166
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:26,751
Still have some

167
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,031
To those promises

168
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,567
Taken away

169
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:33,663
I'm finally I was discussing amazing thing for the exact time

170
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,479
Which is a method that

171
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:42,879
Effectively runs the change of time even though it's only uses a finite

172
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,927
Stop

173
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,487
Brilliant

174
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:51,071
Let's talk about random walk Behavior

175
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,631
I want to

176
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:57,471
Look at a simple a really simple example

177
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,823
Run home

178
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:05,151
Challenge of Running Wolf behavior is

179
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,711
So

180
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,247
Here we have

181
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,295
A little demo

182
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,111
Which is the following

183
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,391
Poly problem

184
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,743
Something you like

185
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,471
So for the polywell

186
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:33,055
The red distribution unnormalized

187
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,359
Is Wong

188
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:39,455
In a bunch of places and zero in a bunch of other

189
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,503
Clifton II

190
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:50,463
And it warm whenever X is in this subset of the type of windshield long to read

191
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,999
20

192
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:57,119
Zero Otto i t distribution

193
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:00,959
Which is a very good grass in your head

194
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:12,991
We're going to pretend that we can draw directly from that distribution

195
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:19,647
And to help us we're going to introduce a simple distribution that we can draw from because we do have access to a Fair coin

196
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:24,511
I'm going to make a proposal

197
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,119
The new from the current place at to a new place ex-prime

198
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,655
Can this way

199
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:34,239
We're going to flip a coin and it's going to come out

200
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:38,591
If it comes up heads will say let's move left

201
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,871
It comes up

202
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:43,199
Tails with a right

203
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,479
What unit

204
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:51,135
So this is an example of a nasty distribution which if we actually knew how

205
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,719
Why did walls we would realize it roughly 20

206
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,791
Why the Catholic I was going to be my name

207
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:00,351
The long light tile distribution

208
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:03,679
On the steps that which I was taken care

209
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,615
Call cool pet supplies long from getting a name to my

210
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:15,967
Stepside price at salon

211
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,527
Okay

212
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:24,159
What do I mean by Elwell it's something like the distance from Walton typical point in the typical set

213
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,951
To another physical point

214
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,487
Something like that

215
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,815
You could argue maybe that or else should be Channel

216
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,607
14

217
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:39,007
Awesome questions about this chain

218
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:45,407
Set it going you can imagine if this is plenty

219
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:49,759
Is why I could performance Poison Ivy by The Calling

220
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,319
Inteva moving to the right or the left

221
00:15:54,367 --> 00:16:00,511
This proposed moves when you use them

222
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:06,911
Because the probability ratio between any two

223
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:12,031
I'm a cure so he's always going to be Wong

224
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:15,871
When I have to get the wool if we propose

225
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,175
Moving to the right

226
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,967
Then that will be division

227
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:24,319
And you'll get mixed up with probability of 0 Texas

228
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:28,671
So that's the first 20 steps on the screen

229
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:33,023
All This Time Staffing problem

230
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,375
Monogatari fight

231
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:40,447
How to get to it

232
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,287
I'm not princess right questions for YouTube

233
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,335
Western Wall

234
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,895
Roughly

235
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:55,039
How long will it take until the chain generate a good sample from Pig

236
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,791
Gold Exchange

237
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,839
Tannerite

238
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,167
That's good

239
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,215
Sample from 8

240
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:22,431
I have already to find few good but I just want you to send your neighbor and

241
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:27,551
Answer the question anyway this is the real world

242
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,367
Define things to think

243
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:33,183
So how long is it going to have to run for

244
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:43,679
And if you're struggling with that question is another question which is more precise

245
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,471
I think it's going to be roughly

246
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,495
Until

247
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:49,055
We hit

248
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,335
Hey

249
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:53,151
1 Willowdale

250
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:58,015
Christian Grey how long until weed

251
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:01,087
How long you think you'll be until April

252
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:16,447
Take questions two and three off precise question

253
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:18,751
I'd like you to rub plate

254
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:22,847
Tell me what that how long

255
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,663
It's always that one will how long until

256
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,711
And then you gotta think about whether those

257
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:32,831
Questions are relevant to question 1 how long do you need to run the chainsaw

258
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,623
Stop coughing from

259
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,159
Sciatica pain

260
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,975
Until you think you getting a good

261
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,047
Friends

262
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:50,751
Okay honey

263
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,799
Any of these questions

264
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,991
Okay which question are you

265
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:01,759
Anne Frank

266
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,463
Okay so

267
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:15,327
How to get a good sample from P you're saying it has to have a chance to

268
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,887
Getting quite a long way

269
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:21,727
And that's going to be quite a rare thing that manages to go a long way

270
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:24,031
So your suggestion was

271
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:31,455
Wanted made about 10 unlikely things happened then maybe we will

272
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,783
Anti what is off the 10.

273
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:41,183
That one in a thousand

274
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,975
It might be doing all right

275
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:46,559
Peacock about 10 unlocked

276
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:48,095
Interesting

277
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:52,191
Praying it may well be in writing any other ways

278
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,983
Answering any of these questions

279
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,031
Anyone

280
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:08,831
Okay

281
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:17,023
Okay so you're saying if we have long enough to hit the wall then it's probably long enough

282
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:20,095
Alright. How long is it until we

283
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:23,167
I had to work that you think this is the right time to?

284
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:26,751
About 200 that's why am I 200

285
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,479
Piranha

286
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:42,623
So the distance you got a typical distance you've gone there's something like the square root

287
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,159
Pause the number of times.

288
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,951
Border on the wall

289
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,231
Confirm

290
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:49,279
Even though

291
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:56,191
Did I only take 10 sets in principle to reach the wall

292
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,335
You will

293
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,127
Mystic

294
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:10,527
Toyota

295
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:13,855
And then if you want to get all the way from there to the other Old Navy

296
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:14,879
Broccoli

297
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:22,560
Maybe another 400-500

298
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,864
Do I have a chance of getting back

299
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,936
So let's let's go through the reasoning so

300
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:32,032
Let's define the distance that the random walk with a gum

301
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:37,152
3 is a sum of all the steps we might

302
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,248
So after time capital T

303
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:47,392
The distance to prom

304
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:56,096
Is Ada + 100 - could be zero if we do it rejection

305
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,912
But to start with

306
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:04,800
Where in the middle

307
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:07,872
Either you end up that her up answer

308
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:11,968
And then the stats are Oliva plus minus one variable

309
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,784
Interested in

310
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:17,088
The variance of Delta

311
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,904
Delta active

312
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,208
How far are we from Lancaster

313
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:28,096
How wide is the mission SF

314
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:30,656
Average value

315
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,312
Delta active the sum of independent random variables and so variances ass

316
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:41,664
The banks of LX is the sum of the variances

317
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:50,368
Would you take a single stack to see the volume

318
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:53,184
I'm tired Bavarian

319
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:56,512
Adelta X is T

320
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,096
Okay

321
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:04,192
So if you want

322
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,264
The typical distance of Kong

323
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,824
The elf grass

324
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,128
Then you need

325
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,784
The run this chamber time

326
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:26,464
At Salon Square running at 1 just to show you how this alien General

327
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:27,744
General

328
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:30,304
Little guy that phone is warm

329
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:36,192
These cats were size warm when I said what that means but that's ice Austin TX

330
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,752
Equal spread

331
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:41,568
53 L on it

332
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:44,896
All right that's a nasty scalene

333
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:50,016
Eyes getting quadratically with the ratio of the sides of your face

334
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,040
Good tasting

335
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:54,880
And example

336
00:23:55,136 --> 00:24:00,512
But that didn't either 100 or 400 opening like that answer the question

337
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,816
2 question 3

338
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,632
And I know this may be

339
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:08,704
One of those

340
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:09,728
Which

341
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,032
Keep running the same

342
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,944
Sexiest Russians

343
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:21,248
Haiti attractions

344
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,040
Apprendre decoration

345
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:28,928
We have reached a wool so in this particular on a hundred was a very good guess

346
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:36,864
If you don't bunkering again

347
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:43,264
We went the last one guy 260

348
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,800
Hitting the same wool

349
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,080
300

350
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,872
400

351
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,408
440

352
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:52,992
Okay and then we've gone was supposed to lose

353
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:55,040
400i Generations

354
00:24:56,064 --> 00:25:01,184
Unreasonably in agreement

355
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,464
3D edible

356
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:10,400
Back of envelope

357
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:12,448
Keep on running

358
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:15,776
Imma come back and get that way

359
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,568
And then maybe

360
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:22,432
400 fraction

361
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:27,040
Progress the other side

362
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:28,832
The 500

363
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,880
What about kissing because school

364
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,160
Okay

365
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:36,256
So that's what happens when you run the sink

366
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,304
So it takes

367
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:40,864
Thousands of iterations

368
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,168
To get good independent parts

369
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:52,640
One of the way of visualizing this is to imagine making a histogram over a week of being during the simulation

370
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,944
So hit the histogram a full TS racing

371
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,760
ATI 410

372
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:00,320
This is for the simulation we just did

373
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:04,160
So after 400 race engines

374
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:10,560
Life Alert

375
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,352
Uneven

376
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:18,240
So this is the point at which you might say I've actually got one decent independent sample from this

377
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:22,080
I forgot 500 iterations

378
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,384
Okay

379
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,456
I'm not saying

380
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:33,856
That when you run a metropolis method like this you should throw away all of the point by Juanita

381
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,392
Collectors talking points

382
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:41,792
The really effective number of independent samples

383
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,864
Just contacts

384
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,912
500

385
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:49,984
Okay

386
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:52,288
So that the random walk problem

387
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:57,664
We can analyze it a little bit more

388
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,880
Another way of

389
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,184
Look at this is

390
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:13,792
To make for ourselves the transition probability Matrix

391
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:17,120
We talk shows * 100

392
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:19,424
For the chain that we're running here

393
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,472
It's possible stay

394
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:28,128
And the transition probability

395
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:34,784
Staying where you are

396
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,576
Okay

397
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,648
We can now

398
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:44,768
Answer question wrong

399
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:51,168
Precisely we can say well for any particular generation where you will have

400
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:54,240
If you stop when I say zero

401
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,800
Any question or any

402
00:27:57,056 --> 00:28:02,176
Starting position and we can plot the point where you will have I stayed upstairs

403
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,200
So

404
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:10,624
This is the answer to the zero set

405
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,392
10

406
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,952
Or in like I can 17 if that was why you stop it

407
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:15,744
Yellow and blue

408
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,768
Those two

409
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,376
Starting out with the probability of being in

410
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:25,984
Or public opinion state 17

411
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,520
Then after one set

412
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:30,080
You're either in these

413
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:36,224
615 East Yellow Pages

414
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:40,320
Okay this is your distribution

415
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:42,112
After three steps

416
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:43,648
That's your distribution

417
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,696
Can you recognize this

418
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:50,048
1331 Ingleside Street

419
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:52,352
Pascal's triangle

420
00:28:55,168 --> 00:29:00,288
This one 46416 at the blue distribution

421
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,848
Is 146

422
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:09,248
4 and 1 steps

423
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:23,072
But that's the next row of Pascal's triangle except the right hand side. Something is happening

424
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,656
After 6 adoration 7

425
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:31,776
But update. Every 25

426
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:35,360
So that's up to 25 set

427
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:37,920
This is very jagged

428
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,968
Picture in gallery showing you

429
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:42,528
Thank you stop antenna 25 steps

430
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:48,928
It's still quite unlikely to have a war

431
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:50,720
Very likely to be in an hour

432
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:51,744
Location

433
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,304
If you even faces

434
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:56,608
But you have any chance of being

435
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:59,936
So after 50 attractions

436
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:07,872
Alice in Chains mutts if you saw 16 17 you're still very likely to be at the right hand side if you stopped in Middle

437
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:12,480
You're more likely be in the middle in it at the edges and you're very unlikely.

438
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:13,504
Locations

439
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,552
9 + 11

440
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:26,560
Very unlikely to be lucky memory of all the even

441
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:30,656
Only losing it all and even memory whenever it comes to a wolf

442
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:33,984
K75 is ricin

443
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:36,032
100 fraction

444
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:38,848
So if you said you think 100 is enough

445
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:41,408
You might look at this right now and I see pink again

446
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:47,296
Cuz if you run it for under the impression that every time

447
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,576
From The Middle

448
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:53,952
Turn around and around

449
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:58,048
Is it going to be even on me

450
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:01,888
You're not going to get the right numbers

451
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,192
100 isn't quite long enough

452
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,008
Even if you stopped in the middle

453
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:11,360
Indefinite not long enough if you start at 17 because

454
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:16,480
You've got a much lower transom uniform of being in 0 after I understand

455
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:18,784
Keep dying at 5

456
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,808
Sympathy

457
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,344
775

458
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:22,880
200

459
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,416
Okay

460
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:26,464
Pretty unicorn out of the rough

461
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:30,560
Yeah you could be pretty much anywhere after 200

462
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:35,168
Or after 4400

463
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:38,496
It's becoming fatty.

464
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,312
Would more likely to be in

465
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,360
All states

466
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,384
And yellow

467
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:51,040
I love it on now it will likely be an even state

468
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:51,808
We keep on going

469
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,136
355 360

470
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:58,208
3 * 400 set

471
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:01,536
You can hardly see on the screen the difference between

472
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,584
Yellow and the blue

473
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:14,848
Republicanism

474
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:18,944
After 500 stats

475
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,160
Okay

476
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:29,696
Good

477
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,000
Any questions about

478
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,024
Christopher

479
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:37,376
So the general message recall is

480
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:41,216
If you make sets of size at salon

481
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:46,080
But it's the distribution of dealing with his got a characteristic of blank tail

482
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,640
Oh in the same units

483
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:54,272
A random walk method is going to take at least one square

484
00:32:54,784 --> 00:33:00,928
I think to get around it may be what because I might be other properties

485
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:05,536
Then you have to run to even longer

486
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:06,816
Service

487
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:13,216
Number regarding DSL on square is just a band it's a love I love how long

488
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:13,984
Have to run

489
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,288
One of these nights

490
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:24,736
Everything I've done you hair is in one dimension let's just make clear how it relates to

491
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,808
Hi Adonis No Problems in a typical

492
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:28,832
Problem

493
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:32,160
It's a it's an inference problem that you're working on

494
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,440
Nipple of these

495
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:38,816
Things called unknown parameters but not being determined by data

496
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:42,912
Then

497
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:47,008
In the real world

498
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,032
Promises

499
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:50,080
Answer

500
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:52,128
The nasty red distribution

501
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,968
They look more like this

502
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,064
It may be two dimensional it maybe even thousand dimensional

503
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:06,464
And it'll have some long length styles and some length styles that are

504
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,024
So

505
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:13,376
In general you might have

506
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:15,424
Pacific

507
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,960
Of the real situation

508
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:23,616
That might be damaged Dimensions gammoth Ogio good

509
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,664
Diamond Dimensions

510
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,736
Where the night Stylistics let's IL

511
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:33,088
And then there might be K -, other dimensions

512
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:35,904
The lifestyle isn't much larger

513
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:43,840
These would be the pulley determine the total number of promises

514
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:49,216
Canine is gamma dimensions of pulley just have invited I thought you haven't seen them down yet

515
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:52,032
And Gamma are welded coming by today

516
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,360
What is your effective number

517
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:57,408
Number of degrees of freedom

518
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,992
Number 1207 promises

519
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,088
And 59 give yourself a Stepside

520
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,112
Pet salon

521
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:11,488
You could imagine at Salaam

522
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,024
Being

523
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:15,072
As small as hell

524
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:19,168
So you could use as your step size 3 Metropolis method

525
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:23,264
Something respect the time you left alone

526
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,824
Or you could use something

527
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,640
I think

528
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,432
Or I could use something

529
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,808
Reading when you're designing in Metropolis

530
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:37,600
Thang Long

531
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:40,672
Be any size you want you pick that

532
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:43,744
What's going to happen now well

533
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:48,608
All your pets are accepted and you just do a random walk

534
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:50,656
Then it's still the case

535
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:53,984
That the typical distance you will have gum

536
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:58,080
After teeth that is growing as a square root

537
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,176
It's going to take you

538
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:14,208
At least I will not songs glad that you get around from one independent points into another

539
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,232
Effectively

540
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,256
Independent party

541
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:18,048
They need at least

542
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,632
Element

543
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,496
The fresh Independence Point

544
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,104
Fresh Independence sample

545
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:40,064
So that pushes you to say well I want at Salon to be really big then for the salon

546
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,600
Is a smooth possible

547
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,928
Which is true

548
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:49,536
They saying let's make it fun as big as we can

549
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,072
However

550
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:56,192
If you make at Salon really big make is big as hell for example

551
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:58,496
Big Al

552
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:01,568
Then what can actually happen

553
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:07,200
Well if you are in the typical sat and you make a proposal from this big green stair hair

554
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,504
Wait remember

555
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:10,784
Is

556
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:15,136
Ghana diamonds in the whole place is K dimensional

557
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:17,440
A demo of those dimensions

558
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:21,792
Take us off this time

559
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:25,376
I'm in so many looked at me

560
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:32,288
Well that means is the probability of making it except move

561
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,824
Going to be the ratio of

562
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,360
5th volume

563
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,432
Bitcoin

564
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,504
Anthony

565
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,808
Just think about that

566
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:51,744
You use an analog that significantly bigger than little a little like that

567
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,840
Then the probability of making expected move

568
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,888
This tiny

569
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:58,912
It's

570
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:05,312
In all of the long Dimensions you don't need to worry you're very unlikely to.

571
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:09,664
Beat the chance of thing on the pancake is is Tiny

572
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,944
It's going to be

573
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,736
The volume of the pancake

574
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:20,416
Indeed job site

575
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:24,512
You got that link Grace's how, which is the number of dimensions

576
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,792
Waco

577
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:27,072
Pancake

578
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:30,656
And then you divide that by the volume of the sphere that you're drawing from

579
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:31,680
This is

580
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:35,008
Accepted movie

581
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:39,872
And that is

582
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,408
Ratio all

583
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,456
Al the little length

584
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:45,248
Oval step by step one

585
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:51,136
Rice to possibly quite a big number Ghana the number of Wellington

586
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:53,184
This is a disaster

587
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:55,744
You make that phone big

588
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:59,328
Inside if you make it bigger than little Al at school

589
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:01,376
Essentially does a constrained

590
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,400
That

591
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:03,680
He comes

592
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:06,240
Goat app

593
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:10,592
Petland great of an owl

594
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,128
Is that news

595
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,176
Because

596
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:21,088
Even though you wanted to you know that reduced your random properties

597
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:23,136
He wanted to go hat

598
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:29,792
You're likely end up with a chain that just sit still and make proposals puzzle and all of those

599
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,072
Rejected

600
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,608
Except

601
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:35,168
A very very small capsules finally

602
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:37,984
Making a proposal it makes a nice people

603
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,056
Kentucky somewhat acceptable but it would happen so rarely

604
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,848
But you don't have to update

605
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,384
So in practice

606
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,176
Be feasible

607
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,224
Sensible

608
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,784
Patty's Restaurant

609
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,648
They're right

610
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:59,744
And obviously you don't want to make them that for me

611
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,280
Actually

612
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:06,912
This is why you want to be you want to somehow know what the smallest think Skyler distribution is

613
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:08,448
Then that's roughly

614
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:11,264
What you want just text I text

615
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:17,664
You're using a simple proposal

616
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:23,552
So in practice people using those sort of

617
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,600
Look up list methods

618
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,672
Will then find

619
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:34,304
That that ultimate song is roughly the smallest light scale

620
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:39,936
And when they run them Acropolis method with that Smollett blank status that set sign

621
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:40,960
Then

622
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:42,752
They will find

623
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:46,848
That that accepting roughly 50% of The Proposal

624
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,456
Resulting optimal acceptance probability

625
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:00,416
Ezra play Aha

626
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:02,208
Possibly a little bit bigger than 1/2

627
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:04,768
But not a million miles from

628
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,888
Okay

629
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:14,240
That I spent

630
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:17,056
Agent book about random walks

631
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:25,760
I know what we want to do is reveal some ways of getting rid of these random

632
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:31,136
Boystown Harrisburg tuition

633
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:37,280
But don't get around by random

634
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,328
In some way such that

635
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:43,424
You're still at

636
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,216
Thought

637
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:50,848
You keep going on a short timescale in it in the consistent Direct

638
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:55,967
Black Gold number one and number two is it the pain in the neck

639
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:58,783
Have to Catholic unicep cited

640
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:02,111
If you don't know what she'll just think Skyler your problem is

641
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:07,231
It will really pay off for you to find that out cuz if you use a set sizes too big

642
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:10,559
You let me be running a simulation that will do nothing about the time

643
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:14,399
Did you make it to small you're wasting time you badly

644
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:21,567
It would be brilliant have methods didn't require special sensitive password shooting

645
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:24,895
Aruba

646
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:27,199
Chooses the right that size

647
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:30,527
In a way that is valid using any soda crack

648
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:32,831
So let's know

649
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:35,135
Address both of those

650
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:37,695
By this

651
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:41,535
That we have through all of these pictures hair

652
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,351

Montpelier message

656
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:53,823
And the first efficient method will talk about hamiltonian

657
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:54,847
Multicolor

658
00:42:56,127 --> 00:43:00,479
And hamiltonian Monte Carlo it's something you couldn't do if you got yourself

659
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:01,759
A

660
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:03,295
Color method

661
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:08,671
Which is like the Metropolis message through Justice continuous State space

662
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:15,071
I didn't want used to make him small proposals of small moves using say I got you in distribution

663
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:16,863
Pool problems all that type

664
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,911
You may be able to use

665
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:26,335
This is how it works

666
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:28,639
Find the relevant demo

667
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,903
I'll show you first

668
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,695
A problem

669
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,583
Hidden problem

670
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:53,983
Distribution so we know all about gout

671
00:43:54,239 --> 00:44:00,383
So I'm attempting to sample from the nasty reddish-orange casting distribution which is a highly car

672
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,687
Calcium distribution in two.

673
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:07,807
Staunton from an initial condition doesn't lie in this is so fat

674
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:12,927
And I'm using the Metropolis method making little circle green proposals

675
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:18,047
Circle proposals Pentatonix and

676
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:24,447
Suppose a new place in blue and

677
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:36,991
Did the show goes on screen

678
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:38,271
Tecumseh

679
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,807
The rejection

680
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:44,415
So that was after I sent you a post that I'm running for another fun-filled cystex

681
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:05,151
A little run

682
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:08,223
Sit still

683
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:09,759
What paint dry

684
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:14,367
So that's an example well

685
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,647
No

686
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:18,207
Let me describe to you how

687
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:19,231
The

688
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:20,767
Hamiltonian

689
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:22,047
Monte Carlo

690
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,327
I said what

691
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:25,631
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo

692
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:27,679
Has got two names actually

693
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:31,775
Either call Tony McCullough

694
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:39,455
Or in the old day that you can because hybrid Monte Carlo

695
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,647
Monte Carlo

696
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:51,487
Ricky Seahawks

697
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:55,071
The Cheeky waves at this what

698
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:59,423
We're imagining that we've got a nasty distribution that we are finding very difficult

699
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:00,703
The girlfriend.

700
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:02,751
What we going to do

701
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:06,591
It's going to take this difficult High dimensional problem

702
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:10,431
I'm going to say alright let's make the time in South East twice as big

703
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:15,551
Unless to find a new distribution

704
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:20,159
A new syncope

705
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:22,719
Which is going to be cold the momentum

706
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:30,399
The Joint distribution of X and P

707
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:31,423
To be

708
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:35,007
Division St distribution with us off on x

709
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:36,799
X

710
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:42,687
A simple distribution in a minus B squared

711
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,527
But the momentum variable

712
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:48,319
Appropriately

713
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:50,111
Normalize

714
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,391
What's that

715
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:58,303
So we make the problems faced by sivik

716
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:03,935
Okay you find it difficult

717
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:08,543
It's twice as big and it's not obvious why we should help at all

718
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:11,871
Well the neat thing we've done is

719
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:18,271
You can think of this probability distribution as the in the lineup and energy function

720
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:21,855
But you can think of as a potential energy in space

721
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:25,695
Plus we got the kinetic energy

722
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:27,487
N

723
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:33,375
Hawaii

724
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:40,031
I miss Ryan its total Camilia if you're thinking of your system is a physical system

725
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:41,311
For the potential energy

726
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:45,919
Honda kinetic energy

727
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:51,039
A Newton's laws are a way of getting around on a total Energy company like this

728
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:53,343
In a way that conserves energy

729
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:56,159
I hit the trick

730
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:59,231
We Define an augmented problem is twice as big

731
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:04,607
That opens up with the whole load of new moves we can do we can move around

732
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:09,215
On surfaces of constant total energy by using Newton's Laws

733
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:15,871
What does the real will do in order to sample from nasty distributions like that

734
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:22,271
But you didn't you can close and maybe trying to seem like it.

735
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,807
Interaction with a heat pack

736
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:30,719
I'm because these momentum variables have a very simple distribution we know how to redraw them from

737
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:33,023
Corresponding distribution

738
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:37,119
There every now and then we can have the momentum variable

739
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:43,775
But like what the real world real world use Newton's laws to make text move around and uses little say

740
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:50,175
The x. Is basically something to do with you I meant so you go in the direction of your momentum

741
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:54,783
MP. It's something to do with the floor so you go pee. Is

742
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:58,111
The derivative of energy with respect to X

743
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:01,439
I went both putting in a jetliner

744
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:05,023
What is Newton's Laws you keep going

745
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:13,471
You look at the fourth energy

746
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:15,519
State space variable

747
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:20,127
And you make the momentum change in the

748
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:21,919
All right

749
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:27,807
What time is it in Monte Carlo does

750
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:34,463
Is more complicated than what I just said

751
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:39,071
But the Roughriders this one seem like Newton's Laws

752
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:51,359
And we'll admit that we're out there doing that approximately but we're going to fix up the approximate mess

753
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:58,527
Bye

754
00:49:58,783 --> 00:49:59,807
A clever

755
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:05,951
Call reject rule

756
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:09,535
The checks on what happened to the change in energy

757
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:16,191
The change in the total energy

758
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:19,775
Have your little simulation

759
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:22,591
Unset 3 is

760
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,895
Randomize

761
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:26,943
Levementum

762
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:35,135
Hey by growing it from the correct distribution.

763
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:38,975
And you repeat

764
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:48,703
You can close friend of mine and you run for

765
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:51,519
For a time and can be an arbitrary

766
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:55,359
Tunable promises you will still have to adjust

767
00:50:55,871 --> 00:51:00,479
The simulation will involve little set sizes that you have to actually do Audino

768
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:03,039
LeapFrog method

769
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:08,927
And you have to choose Little Steps of time so it still has parameters which going to be pains in the neck

770
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:12,511
But you don't even know that you're going to be moving along way

771
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:14,559
I'll tell you that

772
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:17,631
To make this whole thing but we

773
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:21,727
Accept or reject every one of those newtonsville simulations

774
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:23,007
It's based on

775
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:29,407
Change it

776
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:32,479
Maybe I'll reject can you flip a coin to determine

777
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:33,503
W words at

778
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:36,575
If the energy goes down

779
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:39,135
But I'll accept it anyway because that's the way

780
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:41,439
I don't see what all the details are in the

781
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,719
Thought the book

782
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:47,071
Let go ahead and show you that thing

783
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:51,679
So we're going to stop and saying stop point

784
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:57,311
And I can do this a few times so you get to see the flavor

785
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,847
Of this

786
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:05,247
Here's what we did we started from the same cell function by the white Arrow

787
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:08,831
I use Newton's Laws with it quieter

788
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:10,623
Love pink set

789
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:17,279
So that let me start remember

790
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:25,471
When were at the station by the White House

791
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:27,519
NFL

792
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:33,919
And then the momentum after the second step we turned right on

793
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:40,319
Bum bum bumbum bum bumbum bum after what is it

794
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:43,647
Penalty stats of Newtonian simulation

795
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:50,047
What happened to the energy

796
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:56,447
Potential energy

797
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:05,151
Three other thing but she might think you could see them

798
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:08,223
When's the father turned around and came back

799
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:12,319
We persisted in lots of different directions

800
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:13,599
Okay

801
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:15,647
Pick up accepted and we run again

802
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:25,119
Now we've gone over that easily gone

803
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:28,447
Link-style this problem if you integrate pedometer

804
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:33,311
Huge long has gone downhill just a little bit as well

805
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:41,759
Do another run remember when we randomize eventually

806
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:49,183
But still have the same total energy

807
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:52,255
When you do step 3 that says randomize momentum

808
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:59,167
That means calm down

809
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:03,263
High speed distance time speed

810
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:07,103
Is high speed you got

811
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:07,871
Speed

812
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:09,407
Border wall

813
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:12,991
Let's go fast

814
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:17,343
Angry end up the Leatherface

815
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:21,183
Again

816
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:23,487
Grand Masti again

817
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:27,327
Friend of mine stay again

818
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:33,727
This is Johnny Contour of energy 102

819
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:36,543
Outside

820
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:39,871
Pot significantly outside again

821
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:42,943
Well let me know a while randomize mental

822
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:48,831
Now that what happened

823
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:51,391
We just happen to go over a short distance

824
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:53,951
Random

825
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:55,743
Okay

826
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:57,279
5 long way

827
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:58,559
Dynamites again

828
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:03,679
And then

829
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:10,079
Right at the bus I sometimes when we went right way

830
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:13,407
Take a right the way along the

831
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:15,711
Okay randomizer next weekend

832
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:19,039
Reducing jiggling around

833
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:25,183
I'll come back again

834
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:27,999
Randomizer

835
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:32,863
But they haven't making much ice to progress around than the standard

836
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:39,007
Ramapo let's go back to Metropolis

837
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:42,335
So what's going on

838
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:48,991
So we stopped and now we're using Metropolis method

839
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:57,183
And every one of these little you blue boxes is created by proposing a random little change and then we evaluate them

840
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:58,719
New energy in that location

841
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:01,535
The amount of computer time it takes

842
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:05,119
Make a note that and find the energy in that new location

843
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:06,911
Is about the same

844
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:10,239
As a Montague archetype if you're using Newton's Laws

845
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:13,567
Can you make a single little set of

846
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,103
Stimulating

847
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:16,895
Victor thing

848
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:23,295
Little change in position importance of a little bit of

849
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:26,367
Take out the energy

850
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:27,647
Right

851
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:34,815
I'm being fat little blue squares in the Metropolis

852
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:37,631
In the hamiltonian

853
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:39,423
Multicolor

854
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,823
Aretha V squishies that were making

855
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:48,895
Please take me to Save-A-Lot

856
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:53,247
LOL that's long Square Times

857
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:59,647
If we go back and stop exactly the same place with hamiltonian Monte Carlo

858
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:07,839
That okay

859
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:08,607
Then

860
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:15,007
With the thing like the computer time is those what was it think you'll so little blue steps

861
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:16,287
All the way to the other side

862
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:29,855
I hope this makes it really is acai

863
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:33,439
And massively reduce the random or behavior

864
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:38,815
But they have a whole bunch of promises you have around with so we may not be completely in love with it

865
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:44,959
Now let's move on to another contact goes over at station

866
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:49,055
The idea of over relaxation is

867
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:50,591
But it can be applied

868
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:52,127
The gift something problems

869
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:56,479
Get something remember doesn't have any

870
00:57:56,991 --> 00:58:01,599
Tunable promises you just grew up in the conditional distribution 85014 time

871
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:07,487
And it doesn't have any obvious way of including momentum. So how can we get this

872
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:08,767
Well

873
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:12,095
Bianca Avila came up with

874
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:14,143
Pickles over outside

875
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:17,727
Where at

876
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:21,055
In standard Gibbs sampling

877
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:26,175
You would have the conditional distribution of the variable

878
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:33,087
You work out the conditional distribution of one of the variables

879
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,903
Conditioning conditional

880
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:39,487
Standard if I'm playing

881
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:43,583
With an s t distribution

882
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:45,631
Texas lice

883
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:49,215
What is the conditional distribution of Wong

884
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:51,007
Stable condition on the other

885
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:55,103
And wherever you are at the moment you just make a fresh grew up in that distribution

886
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:58,175
The other option is

887
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:02,271
If your current position is at prepare this point

888
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:05,599
Then in some cunning way

889
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:09,695
You deliberately draw not from the cracks conditional distribution

890
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:12,511
But from a distribution that somehow by us

891
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:14,303
The opposite side

892
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:16,095
The mode

893
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:20,703
The details are in the book

894
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:22,495
And the two ways of doing this

895
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:24,031
1 is

896
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:27,871
If the conditional distribution that you're talking about is a gascon

897
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:31,967
Pedro from the gas station that is pushed in on the side

898
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:33,759
Off the real castle

899
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:39,391
Simple squishies

900
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:40,671
Improve

901
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:43,487
Publicly you'll end up doing the right thing

902
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:45,279
The atlas method

903
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:48,095
Ratasha you now

904
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:51,935
Is a very simple method

905
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:56,543
For the conditional distributions

906
00:59:58,335 --> 00:59:59,615
I got you

907
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:14,975
And you might say well how can it possibly be interesting if all your conditional distributions on Gaskins

908
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:17,791
Working with is a very simple distribution

909
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:21,887
Well that do exist interesting distributions

910
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:27,007
Pull up whose condition this weekend yet The Joint distribution is very difficult

911
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:30,079
What's up with this is an interesting Tech abilities have

912
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:35,199
Let me show you Outlook message on the gas industry shoe

913
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:46,207
Sorry son hamiltonian what color

914
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:49,535
This is what gives something looks like

915
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:51,071
For the same

916
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:54,143
We were just playing with

917
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:58,751
But has no promises at all

918
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:01,567
But the typical steps you take

919
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:06,687
When you draw from the conditional distributions this way or the conditions

920
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:12,575
Pick up those two directions

921
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:14,111
Dinner to the wind

922
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:16,671
The thing with the green distribution

923
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:22,047
So you never going to be taking stats aside Big Al there only thing to beat exercise little out

924
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:23,327
But juice

925
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:26,655
Which means that you got a random walk

926
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:32,287
Big Al on Little House Square time to get an independent sample using get something

927
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:35,103
So Atlas message that's says

928
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:36,383
It's that

929
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:38,687
That we drool

930
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:41,247
Deliberately from the opposite side

931
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:43,551
Papa distribution in one way

932
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:47,135
And then we got the other variable we draw from the opposite side of it

933
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:54,047
The net result is shown here in red they can see we're up me run along the comes up with a little bit of War

934
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:55,327
Consul

935
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:58,655
If we zoom in on this I'll show you the individual steps

936
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:01,471
Starting to you

937
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:04,543
I forget Which Way time Wednesday school reversible anyway

938
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:07,871
Let's imagine that we started from the bottom left

939
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:09,663
We started a little bit

940
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:13,247
Above the green console

941
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:18,111
And then wake me up beside still a little bit about the green Council

942
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:23,743
And then again about

943
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:30,143
And that means we persistently don't look at every other position that's what the red line is telling you

944
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:31,935
Wonder long console

945
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:33,471
And it's two dimensional problem

946
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:36,031
You can do this in high dimensions

947
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:38,079
Unfold many problems

948
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:42,175
It turns out to be around them

949
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:47,039
Sandra various ways of revealing the Improvement in performance

950
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:52,927
I'm wanted to invent some simple statistics statistics

951
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:55,231
If they feel too correlation time

952
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:57,535
Is Barry short for statistic

953
01:02:57,791 --> 01:03:02,655
That nothing indication that is a good plan and quickly

954
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:09,055
The hit 8.1

955
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:12,127
Wandering around on the regular I get something

956
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:13,407
Nothing Orange

957
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:16,991
That in red is the umbrella station

958
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:21,087
Bible loathing definitely moving around

959
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:23,647
Pasta

960
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:25,695
Honda

961
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:32,607
And another country to look at this act one square and under get sampling

962
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:35,423
Around from being in the middle of being at one of the extreme

963
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:37,983
Encompass

964
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:40,287
Excellence bad is going

965
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:41,823
Up and down much faster

966
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:44,895
Accrued indication that

967
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:47,199
At least on this time problem

968
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:48,479
What is better

969
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:53,343
Tibet labor relaxation full

970
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:58,975
Conditional distribution

971
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:04,095
Doesn't involve any conditional distribution for the gas and I'm far more interesting than that

972
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:09,727
And the good news for you even if you are interesting to see you can still do

973
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:11,007
Station

974
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:15,871
Using another method ordered over allocation

975
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:20,735
An older driver allocation was invented by Radford Neal

976
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:32,511
Imagine that you are doing get something and you have to have a message

977
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:34,047
Which will draw you

978
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:35,583
The new point

979
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:38,399
From

980
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:39,423
This

981
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:42,751
Conditional distribution

982
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:49,663
And you hopped on the capability and get something to draw a one-year point in this condition distribution

983
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:50,943
Well

984
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:52,223
Benadryl

985
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:55,039
K x from that distribution

986
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:56,319
So you drool

987
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:57,343
Pay times

988
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:04,767
That gives you a whole bunch of points to my look like

989
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:09,631
All right

990
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:14,239
Make it more interesting

991
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:19,103
Couple wear

992
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:25,759
7 Greenpoint

993
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:31,135
The total set of points we have hair is a set of eight points including the one that looks currently

994
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:39,071
And the order they were stationed method says 1 2 3 4 5 6

995
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:41,631
7/8 your opposite point

996
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:44,703
Please go to the third one from the other end

997
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:47,519
Pick up the stick part in this

998
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:51,103
Whatever you want to go to the point

999
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:53,151
All right

1000
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:57,759
And that means if your way over if you would get the white. Was actually

1001
01:05:58,015 --> 01:06:00,575
Number one in the less you would have gone

1002
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:03,903
This is something any real value

1003
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:04,927
Variable

1004
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:12,351
And it probably correct invalid and in practice a good value of K might be something like

1005
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:17,983
Additional work to get 20 rules from this distribution

1006
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:24,639
Quite often not much extra work at all example if you have to use adaptive rejection sampling

1007
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:27,967
If you're using a rejection sampling method to draw

1008
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:31,295
The first of these points in green

1009
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:37,951
Open adaptive rejection sampling has the property that you can get another one point

1010
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:39,999
The pool all of the way

1011
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:42,815
Consumed in getting the first part then the other ones are free

1012
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:46,911
The listing be a very very cheap method and it may well

1013
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:49,471
Improve your running

1014
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:54,335
There's no guarantee but it was funny

1015
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:56,895
Under the piece of stuff that kill bugs

1016
01:06:57,663 --> 01:07:00,735
Which mean faith in inference using Gibbs sampling

1017
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:04,575
Buck's has been around for about 15 or 20 years now

1018
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:09,183
On my way of England to give something for a whole

1019
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:13,023
Different models

1020
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:18,399
Using a simple declarative language and then it figured out how to run to get something for you

1021
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:23,263
And I'm pretty sure that the buttons of bugs right now

1022
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:26,079
Ordered over a Station built into them

1023
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:32,223
So you can get this speed up for free or you can at least give you speed up

1024
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:35,807
Okay

1025
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:43,999
We've been gone for an hour so we just carry on with the advance message

1026
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:44,767
Need a break

1027
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:47,327
Let's keep going

1028
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:48,607
Stop

1029
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:49,887
Oberlin station

1030
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:55,519
I would like to move on to this question of dependence on parameters

1031
01:07:58,847 --> 01:07:59,871
The vanilla

1032
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:02,175
Metropolis method we're talking about

1033
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:06,783
Used a gaussian distribution with somewhere and the width of that distribution was

1034
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:10,879
Crucially important we wanted it to be as big as possible and no bigger

1035
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:17,535
When are you turning Monte Carlo site promises

1036
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:23,935
Get something doesn't have any promises which means that maybe we like it

1037
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:31,615
But get something only works if you got a problem where you know how to draw from the conditional

1038
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:32,383
Distribution

1039
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:35,711
But it may be that you're in the world but you just

1040
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:42,111
Haven't got a clue how to do that go energy function

1041
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:48,255
It would be nice to have a method to automatically discovers Bristol the right Stepside

1042
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:51,071
Imats looks like something goes

1043
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:54,399
Are you allowed to go

1044
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:56,447
Play something

1045
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:02,847
Play something was invented by two people

1046
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:14,111
Night night

1047
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:15,391
Rapid meal

1048
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:27,423
And it's a very elegant

1049
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:33,823
Amazingly simple looking way of solving the problem it looks so simple you could imagine it

1050
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:37,663
8A School tile in Bensonhurst Bay and eat myself

1051
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:42,271
So let me show you

1052
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:48,159
Buy something

1053
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:54,303
I'll do it first four

1054
01:09:57,631 --> 01:10:02,239
Good old red one-dimensional distribution

1055
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:08,639
Is you can do it in many. Mention by doing one by Mexicans just like

1056
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:10,687
You pick a single dimension

1057
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:16,575
The weapon for a single direction direction you want in your in your continued State space

1058
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:17,599
And you

1059
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:21,695
Use the method described in that one dimension

1060
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:23,999
And then repeat in other dimensions

1061
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:26,047
So his logos

1062
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:28,095
We have

1063
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:31,679
A nasty red distribution

1064
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:33,983
Let me have a current location

1065
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:35,775
Physical activity

1066
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:43,711
And I'm not going to describe to you how we get to the next location which will collect

1067
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:45,247
But it's going to be quiet

1068
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:47,039
A few steps so

1069
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:56,255
At the current location XT

1070
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:59,071
We evaluate Pizza

1071
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:01,631
This is a graph of pizza

1072
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:04,191
Find week

1073
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:07,263
Then

1074
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:10,847
We draw a point uniformly between 0

1075
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:12,895
Antique star of x

1076
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:15,455
And we can think of that has picking a

1077
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:17,247
Point on Metallica

1078
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:20,831
Then

1079
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:24,671
Recreate

1080
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:27,231
Horizontal

1081
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:28,255
Objects

1082
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:29,535
Of with

1083
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:30,815
W

1084
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:35,935
Where W is going to be a set size parameter office like something method

1085
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:42,335
Whose body we don't care about very much because the whole thing is going to be robust to it

1086
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:43,103
Might be

1087
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:45,663
We make a little object like that

1088
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:47,199
Little green thing

1089
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:50,271
It's height is determined by the height of white.

1090
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:52,575
And it's off that

1091
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:57,183
Is chosen randomly uniformly from Oak Bluff that from

1092
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:58,975
The two little

1093
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:02,559
End of the green Pole

1094
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:08,703
It's either aligned with white uniform

1095
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:09,727
3 pic

1096
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:12,799
A uniform choice of this little cars uncle

1097
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:14,591
Trucks coming off the telegraph Pole

1098
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:17,663
All right I was tattoo

1099
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:19,711
Step 3 is

1100
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:21,247
Check to see

1101
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:23,807
Those two places

1102
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:26,879
What the value of pizza that

1103
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:29,183
I must value Pizza

1104
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:30,207
That

1105
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:31,743
And it

1106
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:34,559
Victorio's Pizza is a bug

1107
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:39,167
The Greenline for today is

1108
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:40,703
That's not far enough

1109
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:42,751
Let's make an additional set

1110
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:44,287
The 5w

1111
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:48,127
And then check

1112
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:51,455
You keep on stepping out until when you check

1113
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:52,479
At that

1114
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:54,271
Play

1115
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:56,319
Are we above Pizza

1116
01:12:57,087 --> 01:13:01,439
We aren't the hair was already yes we're above so we stop stepping out from this direction

1117
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:03,231
In this direction

1118
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:06,815
We have to step out once and then go to Check Yes or above

1119
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:13,983
I'm by that person street now created a wide a green object

1120
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:17,055
Then

1121
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:18,591
Connecting vide

1122
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:25,247
Is we drool uniformly from the green line that we can just break it so you pick any point to go on the green line

1123
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:28,575
Which could be for example

1124
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:39,071
And this is our candidate that were probably going to end up calling XT

1125
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:41,119
Check one more thing namely

1126
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:43,679
If you look that

1127
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:45,215
Does that

1128
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:47,263
Point lie about the red cup

1129
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:49,311
And if it doesn't

1130
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:52,639
We're okay if it does lie about the right there

1131
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:54,943
What's up no good sorry

1132
01:13:56,735 --> 01:14:00,575
I didn't get that does lie about right there sorry that's not good

1133
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:01,599
And

1134
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:06,207
To make things run a bit faster you can optionally

1135
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:10,815
Wipe out all of the green stuff that live beyond this projected point

1136
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:16,447
Away from it in the central away from the white.

1137
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:17,727
Okay

1138
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:19,007
Sorry

1139
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:21,823
Propose the point on the green line

1140
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:28,479
We drew on that was above the rat we rejected it and I was crying again

1141
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:33,855
Until you get one and maybe in probably like that this

1142
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:35,647
Of 1/2

1143
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:38,975
In which case now you say no that's projected to cut it

1144
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:44,351
Flying above the red cup to valuations of pizza

1145
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:47,935
Green hair

1146
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:52,543
Next another screen thing is really quite a snug fit around the Red Tub

1147
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:58,943
The next time you're very unlikely that we're going to miss this

1148
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:03,039
Live below the red cup

1149
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:08,415
Homicide rate you're accepted

1150
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:09,951
How many kilometers from that

1151
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:11,231
Do that

1152
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:14,303
Amazon

1153
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:21,471
Many white everything that you have done had except you keep track of it by your pizza

1154
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:23,519
And you repeat

1155
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:28,895
I think that there's on the computer

1156
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:33,247
Suck a location

1157
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:37,087
Aurora Bushkill point in yellow

1158
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:40,671
Recreate the green thing of with w

1159
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:46,047
How it look the potential on the Galaxy

1160
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:52,447
Now we chat all the green endpoint outside above the the red cup

1161
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:56,799
The woman left

1162
01:15:57,055 --> 01:16:00,383
Now you drool in blue and you point in the green line

1163
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:02,431
And that is underneath

1164
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:03,711
The red pill

1165
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:06,271
I'm sorry I'm a dog

1166
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:08,575
Presta

1167
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:10,879
Go to point uniformly on the line

1168
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:14,207
Make a thing of width w

1169
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:16,767
Girl from it

1170
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:20,095
And like the loser a cup

1171
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:20,863
I will done

1172
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:24,447
No time when we're done

1173
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:28,031
This problem has appeared at the very least it'll come back bump

1174
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:31,871
We're moving right the way from one side to the other side of the distribution

1175
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:34,943
Petrosmith purple line

1176
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:40,831
Now we broke something high up because this is a place where p is Big possible for the green truck to be high up

1177
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:42,879
Now I don't got to go so far all we

1178
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:45,695
And

1179
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:47,999
Let me draw from the green thing

1180
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:51,071
We can't go right over into the right hand side

1181
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:53,375
There's going to be rejected

1182
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:59,775
We automatically stay in the place with an r o t

1183
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:02,847
Because it's that bad a shorter distance

1184
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:07,455
And now we feel alone will we go fight a long way

1185
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:14,111
It was above the red line

1186
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:16,671
They know that we try again

1187
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:20,767
Again

1188
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:27,679
Spice that looks like something I'll let it run for a hundred

1189
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:29,983
Doing its thing

1190
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:39,455
And you can associate each of the acceptances was underneath the way you prove the favorite

1191
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:45,343
That's like something. The right thing did you prove it at least this distribution under the tub in Burien

1192
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:46,623
That the

1193
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:47,903
Technic

1194
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:51,231
That looks like something full

1195
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:54,815
Did not see distribution in Rat I think it looks more exciting

1196
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:57,375
And more incredible would it really what

1197
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:59,679
If we do it for a more

1198
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:04,287
Oakwood looking distribution that might look fly

1199
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:10,687
So there in red is it stalking distribution

1200
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:14,015
I let you slide something on it

1201
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:17,343
Right I forgot

1202
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:20,159
So that's how yellow thing

1203
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:24,767
Now are we done do we need

1204
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:26,815
On the left playlist

1205
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:29,887
But still under the right there on the right

1206
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:33,983
Okay we did. Greenpoint play the rest

1207
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:35,775
The respect that like that

1208
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:39,359
Now and we draw a point on the Green

1209
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:40,127
Blind

1210
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:45,247
Is any of the Rat

1211
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:50,111
Example is above the red light

1212
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:52,671
Drinking tour Seattle

1213
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:55,743
Now we make another girl from the green line

1214
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:59,839
So he stayed home in one piece

1215
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:02,655
Now

1216
01:19:03,423 --> 01:19:04,447
Make a cross drop

1217
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:09,567
Dorothy from one place to another

1218
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:13,919
And we could have done that no matter how low the valley is

1219
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:16,735
Make lucky Leaf across very very

1220
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:23,647
Nasty valleys in Peoria Hills could be in the way

1221
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:25,695
And yet we can cuddle accustomed

1222
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:28,255
Locate those going from one place to another

1223
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:34,143
And now look where that yelling pointing it's really really like that was

1224
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:38,751
Tonight when do the rules green thing

1225
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:44,127
Dentacoin

1226
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:47,711
Small please thank you

1227
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:53,599
I would keep going

1228
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:56,927
Spypoint

1229
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:58,463
If you run it for longer

1230
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:02,559
Visiting all of the peeps

1231
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:10,495
So that's like something

1232
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:15,104
It's pretty cool idea rapid nailer

1233
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,408
Publix free software that implements

1234
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:18,432
This message

1235
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:19,200
And it's

1236
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:23,552
Very very gentle all you need is the ability to evaluate a function

1237
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:24,576
Where You Are

1238
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:29,440
A really nice thing to next events like something is it never

1239
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:31,232
Ends up rejecting

1240
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:37,632
The overall proposal

1241
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:44,800
Turn contrast standard Metropolis message where you want.

1242
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:55,040
I have made any progress if you always will move possibly a very small distance

1243
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:58,368
Maybe a typical set

1244
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:02,976
So it never attacked another beauty of

1245
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:04,512
It's like something is

1246
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:07,840
Step size W is not a crucial parameter

1247
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:14,240
If UW is accidentally 10 times as big as it needs to be

1248
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:16,800
Moore Lumber bluepoint to shrink down

1249
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:18,336
Shrinkage process

1250
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:26,784
And if your W-2 is too small

1251
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,832
Overly small green thing

1252
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:32,160
Only small number of us will be required

1253
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:35,232
To Encompass the width of the registration

1254
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:36,256
So

1255
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:42,656
W isn't crucial but you don't have a cow

1256
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:44,192
You too small to latch

1257
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:50,080
Play something. Type of property that typically you will make the steps

1258
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:53,920
That is as big as the width of the people you're dealing with

1259
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:56,736
Beat the final stats

1260
01:21:56,992 --> 01:22:00,064
Is all broccoli the optimal size

1261
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:05,952
Okay

1262
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:08,768
That's why something

1263
01:22:11,328 --> 01:22:14,400
And I would like to finish with today is talking about

1264
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:15,680
Exact sampling

1265
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:20,288
So how long do you need to run a Monte Carlo method for

1266
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:22,848
I'm going to tell you

1267
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:29,760
What feels to me like really quite amazing breakthrough of the month Tyler Community

1268
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:30,528
Question

1269
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:36,928
How long do I need to run it Forward well how long is he staying you don't really know you just to feel you

1270
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:40,768
Mason Diagnostic lab

1271
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:42,816
How long should I run at 4

1272
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:44,608
You always have this type of pie

1273
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:49,984
Well there was a breakthrough and it happened in approximately 1996

1274
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:56,384
With the invention of methods to talk to Michael and exact time

1275
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:58,944
Under the whole family of different

1276
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,480
Perfect sampling

1277
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:06,880
Method and I'm going to just drive to the easiest one to explain this probably

1278
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:10,720
Tens of papers on the maybe even hundreds

1279
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:16,096
How long should we run the simulations for

1280
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:18,656
Well

1281
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:23,520
Exact sampling is based on the idea that you should

1282
01:23:23,776 --> 01:23:26,336
Run it for a long time because venue fun

1283
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,640
How long

1284
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:32,992
Infinitely law

1285
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:34,784
Adapter

1286
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:39,648
Young Mike Tyson

1287
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:43,232
Okay that sounds like a lot of computer

1288
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:46,816
You can establish the outcome of an infinitely long

1289
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:48,352
Computer simulation

1290
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:50,912
Finite

1291
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:54,240
I'm going to run

1292
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:55,776
The simulation

1293
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:57,056
From the past

1294
01:23:57,824 --> 01:23:59,360
From infinitely long in the past

1295
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:04,480
The presence

1296
01:24:06,784 --> 01:24:08,064
So how does that help

1297
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:10,880
Let me explain

1298
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:15,232
Let's imagine this is the state space

1299
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:17,536
Kissing license

1300
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:25,216
Simplicity let's imagine with talking about the Electra flipping the coin

1301
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:29,824
To determine whether he goes right or left in the Lexus IS250

1302
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:30,592
Paces

1303
01:24:30,848 --> 01:24:32,384
Why the State Bank

1304
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:34,688
Guys like this

1305
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:39,552
I know what I'm asking you to imagine is it an infinite time ago

1306
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:42,112
A little army of 21

1307
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:46,976
Lecherous

1308
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:48,768
Ulta

1309
01:24:49,536 --> 01:24:51,328
Infinity

1310
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:53,120
In

1311
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:56,448
Difference among different locations and every one of them

1312
01:24:56,704 --> 01:25:01,312
Then started running the Monte Carlo simulation of the Metropolis alfredo

1313
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:04,384
Imagine that

1314
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:08,224
Imagine that they use the same random numbers

1315
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:10,272
So

1316
01:25:10,784 --> 01:25:12,064
Random numbers

1317
01:25:14,112 --> 01:25:17,184
All of them are showing hat and the first one

1318
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:23,328
Dial pad

1319
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:29,984
Anytime remodeling we can consult a little Encyclopedia of outcomes that we can stay at

1320
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:36,384
Hi - 1732 what was it

1321
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:42,784
Whenever you come back to this

1322
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:44,576
Something to it will tell you

1323
01:25:45,344 --> 01:25:47,904
Write the all of them are getting along

1324
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,024
The head one of them

1325
01:25:59,424 --> 01:26:00,192
Unisafe

1326
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:03,520
Is there anyway I can figure out

1327
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:05,056
Where

1328
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:06,592
One of these is

1329
01:26:07,104 --> 01:26:08,384
At that time

1330
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:12,992
Without having to stop at time minus infinity

1331
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:14,784
Could you do that

1332
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:17,600
Well maybe you could because

1333
01:26:18,368 --> 01:26:20,416
Looks like you don't know why

1334
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:22,720
Any of them got to

1335
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:24,768
What time - 172

1336
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:27,584
It's at that you do know that

1337
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:33,984
They must have been either in this table that take all this take

1338
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:42,432
I miss you without knowing which of those is true if you run all funky one of them forward

1339
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:45,760
In time it's excellent just see now what would happen

1340
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:47,808
3 to the 21 hypotheses

1341
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:52,672
So you can try all 21 of them and run them forward

1342
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:54,720
Just for this time

1343
01:26:55,488 --> 01:26:56,256
Up to the present

1344
01:26:56,512 --> 01:27:01,376
And it all of these end up

1345
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:04,448
Colliding with walls and that of the thing

1346
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:07,008
Such a way that oil 20 Wang

1347
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:10,336
End up repair

1348
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:18,016
Then it must be the case but opens one of these guys have ended up even though you don't know where they were

1349
01:27:19,552 --> 01:27:20,832
So this is the trip

1350
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:22,624
The trick is

1351
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:25,952
Marketing

1352
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:30,304
Monte Carlo simulations have a property that they do coalesce in time

1353
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:32,608
So if you take all the

1354
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:35,424
State-based - 172

1355
01:27:36,192 --> 01:27:36,960
Arundel Ford

1356
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:42,336
Maybe you'll find it all gazillion or 21

1357
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:43,616
A v state

1358
01:27:43,872 --> 01:27:45,920
Will have coalesced into a single site

1359
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:48,736
We plan that

1360
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:51,296
If you had a different time

1361
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:58,208
You would have come somewhere in this point which that for is where you would have

1362
01:27:58,464 --> 01:28:00,768
By running this thing

1363
01:28:02,816 --> 01:28:06,656
So what's the exact time

1364
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:09,728
Pick a time into the past

1365
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:13,568
Whatever 100 * 500

1366
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,872
Pick whatever you want it doesn't matter

1367
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:17,664
There we go back a hundred steps

1368
01:28:18,176 --> 01:28:22,528
Now send me like pulled in time every single initial condition

1369
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,320
That you could have been at

1370
01:28:25,088 --> 01:28:26,368
100 * PepsiCo

1371
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:32,512
Or if you can get away with it stimulates you was in that because maybe you don't need to be like

1372
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:34,560
Stimulate the most forward in time

1373
01:28:36,096 --> 01:28:37,632
If they reach

1374
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:39,424
Different Pointe

1375
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:43,264
Note that that oil using the same

1376
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:46,592
Random coin flip to the numbers

1377
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:49,408
But they're all using the same random numbers

1378
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:56,064
That means it's two of them dudes in the same state as he tell her some point they will remain in lockstep

1379
01:28:58,368 --> 01:29:00,416
45 * 0

1380
01:29:01,184 --> 01:29:03,232
Is that they are in several States

1381
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:07,584
Besides okay bummer but we're not done yet we go back

1382
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:09,632
Maybe

1383
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:13,728
And repeat the operation

1384
01:29:14,752 --> 01:29:16,544
And see if these guys

1385
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:18,336
By the time you go for us

1386
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:23,712
How come I haven't you.

1387
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:26,528
Maybe the 400

1388
01:29:26,784 --> 01:29:27,552
Until

1389
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:29,344
The hovel coalesced

1390
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:34,464
And then you follow them along and you see where they all ended

1391
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:36,512
And then you can declare this site

1392
01:29:37,024 --> 01:29:38,560
Is where you would have got to

1393
01:29:41,888 --> 01:29:43,168
That's the message

1394
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:49,568
That is very expensive in general because you have to stimulate 21 initial conditions or in general

1395
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:51,616
A big number

1396
01:29:53,152 --> 01:29:55,200
If you're really really really coming

1397
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:59,808
You can establish that I have old

1398
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:04,672
But a special case of the 21 letters you actually only need to stimulate

1399
01:30:05,184 --> 01:30:07,744
The rightmost Electra on the leftmost Electra

1400
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,024
Are you see if those

1401
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:12,352
End up sitting on top of each other

1402
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:14,912
Then only intermediate letras mustard

1403
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:20,032
That's the general idea of most exact

1404
01:30:20,288 --> 01:30:22,336
They have some way of ordering

1405
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:23,872
The state space

1406
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:28,736
And then you have the highest state Valera station

1407
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:31,040
And then if they have coalesced

1408
01:30:31,808 --> 01:30:33,344
Valentine's Arrow

1409
01:30:33,856 --> 01:30:35,392
Ducati stop at Suffolk Temple

1410
01:30:35,648 --> 01:30:38,976
Haven't you just go back to exactly the same

1411
01:30:39,488 --> 01:30:40,768
They take the highest state

1412
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:46,656
It's been like that for you have to do to prove this is valid

1413
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:51,008
I'm going to show you some beautiful examples of the snow

1414
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:53,824
So that example

1415
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:54,848
Is

1416
01:30:55,104 --> 01:30:57,408
To draw a random filing of a hexagon

1417
01:30:58,176 --> 01:31:01,248
So here's a hexagon tiles with red

1418
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:04,064
Blue and green Los Angeles

1419
01:31:04,576 --> 01:31:08,160
The Los Angeles Kings have three orientations and I started by the three different colors

1420
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:14,816
And you can think of it also is a piling of a hexagon with

1421
01:31:15,072 --> 01:31:18,400
Feeling a Brickyard with cubicles

1422
01:31:18,912 --> 01:31:19,936
Nataska is

1423
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:24,800
Please give me a random piling of asking a perfectly random piling

1424
01:31:25,056 --> 01:31:26,080
Hexagon

1425
01:31:26,592 --> 01:31:29,664
Until you invented Markov chain which is it

1426
01:31:30,432 --> 01:31:36,576
Adding and removing Brick from The Brickyard how long do I need to add new baby

1427
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:42,976
The Brickyard lamp that can be well will do

1428
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:45,536
Established that completely full Brickyard

1429
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:51,936
Both have ended up in the same state

1430
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:56,544
Tell him the Lester have the empty Rick Ross and on the right we have the food Brickyard

1431
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:59,360
I support in time and it didn't work

1432
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:03,200
So we go back from 108 that 256 that

1433
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:04,224
In the past

1434
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:06,016
Botanica

1435
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:09,856
Keep going and there is a perfect timing of vacuum

1436
01:32:10,368 --> 01:32:16,512
And so that's how long it took us 256 units of computer time to get the answer

1437
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:19,584
Find

1438
01:32:21,376 --> 01:32:22,144
Do it again

1439
01:32:22,656 --> 01:32:23,936
Ogden Clinic fax

1440
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:27,520
Go back to the 206

1441
01:32:29,312 --> 01:32:33,664
That is using a different fresh set of random numbers that are defined

1442
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:35,456
How's it going

1443
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:41,856
Under $0.48

1444
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:43,904
How's it going

1445
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:46,976
Know or go back to

1446
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:49,024
50 Cent

1447
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:50,304
Stetsonville pass

1448
01:32:52,096 --> 01:32:58,240
NB

1449
01:32:58,496 --> 01:33:04,640
When they helped coalesce because coalescence of unusual sites like when two letrozole

1450
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:17,952
The answer isn't when Nicole

1451
01:33:18,464 --> 01:33:19,232
Simulation

1452
01:33:19,744 --> 01:33:22,048
All right you don't see any more of those I'll give you one more

1453
01:33:24,864 --> 01:33:26,144
Occasionally it takes

1454
01:33:26,656 --> 01:33:30,496
More than 256 Steps From the Past

1455
01:33:35,872 --> 01:33:39,200
When I said that that's up for this particular size of hexagon

1456
01:33:40,992 --> 01:33:42,528
Running this particular algorithm

1457
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:47,648
And that's another calling for free

1458
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:53,536
They might say who cares about filing well I'm not sure this is useful for

1459
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:59,168
But things are very beautiful things and through this work on exact sampling of Thailand

1460
01:34:00,704 --> 01:34:01,984
Some discoveries will make

1461
01:34:03,008 --> 01:34:03,776
So

1462
01:34:04,544 --> 01:34:06,080
There is a perfect

1463
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:09,920
Piling using those three voltages

1464
01:34:10,688 --> 01:34:14,272
I'm here is a perfect filing of an even bigger hexagon

1465
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:16,064
When you look at that

1466
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:18,112
You might start with a

1467
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:19,392
Is something happening

1468
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:22,208
Is there a perfect circle appearing

1469
01:34:22,976 --> 01:34:26,048
I'm at Frozen all the tiles are red

1470
01:34:29,632 --> 01:34:34,496
Arctic Circle

1471
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:35,520
Anaconda

1472
01:34:36,032 --> 01:34:39,104
And they injected on the basis of this work on

1473
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:41,152
Randomly generate timing

1474
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:44,736
Maybe a random filing of a hexagon has the property

1475
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:52,672
Beyond which is Frozen

1476
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:53,696
It was discovered

1477
01:34:53,952 --> 01:34:55,488
Thanks to exact template

1478
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:59,328
Fine example I want to show you

1479
01:34:59,584 --> 01:35:02,144
Is atrovent achtung models

1480
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:06,240
Favorite toy weld of the

1481
01:35:08,544 --> 01:35:11,616
If you went back before 1996

Arrest people

1483
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:19,552
Oh goodness me this very interesting icing mobile that are cut about pay transitions it's a bit of a

1484
01:35:19,808 --> 01:35:25,184
Middlesex that melting of ice and that sort of thing is so critical phenomena doesn't fluctuations

1485
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:26,464
When it melts

1486
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:30,816
Tell me I would stimulate game of the month

1487
01:35:31,072 --> 01:35:35,424
What should I get for I want to make a really good sample

1488
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:41,824
People decide the Billabong time is it called

1489
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:43,104
Slowing down

1490
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:50,016
Very long time and no one really knows how long does it take for

1491
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:56,416
In 96 this exact time Glen community made a breakthrough

1492
01:35:56,672 --> 01:36:02,816
Epic comparable to breakthrough in superconductivity When I Was An undergraduate in your warm like that

1493
01:36:07,168 --> 01:36:08,704
And then two years later

1494
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:15,104
Turn back to the election

1495
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:18,432
I could do

1496
01:36:18,688 --> 01:36:22,784
And a similar breakthrough Andrew lightning model

1497
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:24,576
Which means that

1498
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:26,624
It's not possible

1499
01:36:27,136 --> 01:36:28,672
To show a sample

1500
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:35,328
Organizing model is a perfect sample the critical temperature

1501
01:36:35,584 --> 01:36:36,096
What's the temperature

Call VIP mobile

1503
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:44,544
Just Dance Juicy to ising model C I think model is a spin system for every

1504
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:49,920
Up or down a couple likes to be the same

1505
01:36:50,432 --> 01:36:51,456
But on the other hand it

1506
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:57,856
Temperature so it has a tendency to

1507
01:36:58,112 --> 01:37:04,256
Random what's it look like

1508
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:08,352
Heritage at low temperature

1509
01:37:08,608 --> 01:37:10,400
Tiny bit of blue

1510
01:37:12,192 --> 01:37:12,960
It could be

1511
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:16,032
All white with a tiny bit of blue

1512
01:37:17,312 --> 01:37:18,592
Or it could be

1513
01:37:20,384 --> 01:37:26,272
Dwight Oden doble

1514
01:37:26,784 --> 01:37:28,832
The high temperature is it

1515
01:37:29,344 --> 01:37:30,880
Low temperature

1516

1517
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:44,448

Sleeping stop

1519
01:37:45,728 --> 01:37:48,544
So long

1520
01:37:49,312 --> 01:37:51,360
Then below a certain temperature

1521
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:57,760
It all turns into a single, eventually

1522
01:37:58,016 --> 01:38:02,368
The newspaper

1523
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:07,744
There are other Albertsons you can use with the much quicker missing between the old blue and they will why

1524
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:08,512
States

1525
01:38:10,816 --> 01:38:16,960
This is a different Dupree 1996 States in someone's eye or how long I

1526
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:20,288
The temperature I'm really interested in them.

1527
01:38:20,544 --> 01:38:21,824
Arrow Barber

1528
01:38:22,336 --> 01:38:28,480
I want to get a perfect sample but I don't know how long

1529
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:29,760
Because

1530
01:38:30,016 --> 01:38:36,160
74 really big things that I can measure how big

1531
01:38:37,184 --> 01:38:38,720
So that's the challenge

1532
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:40,000
And

1533
01:38:40,256 --> 01:38:42,048
The exact sampling community

1534
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:48,960
Came up with a method of solving this just a little bit more introductions I mentioned

1535
01:38:49,216 --> 01:38:49,728
Temperature

1536
01:38:49,984 --> 01:38:51,264
I do

1537
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:54,336
Crank which way did it go

1538
01:38:54,592 --> 01:38:58,432
Temperature is going to the right

1539
01:38:58,688 --> 01:39:00,224
The cranky up the temperature

1540
01:39:00,736 --> 01:39:04,832
And what happens to the energy is going to make it with more energy

1541
01:39:05,088 --> 01:39:10,208
Put the fluctuations in Odyssey the standard deviation of the

1542
01:39:10,464 --> 01:39:11,488
Omelette

1543
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,280
I need to see

1544
01:39:13,536 --> 01:39:19,680
At the temperature of 2.305

1545
01:39:21,728 --> 01:39:27,872
There's something wacky going on at the temperature melting from the mainly or blue or white

1546
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:31,456
Into what three states

1547
01:39:31,968 --> 01:39:38,112
The average magnetisation which is how much or blue or white the mean squared minus ization

1548
01:39:38,368 --> 01:39:40,928
Right on Guam

1549
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:45,024
And that very low temperatures it's very very magnetized it's always

1550
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:47,072
In Pilot knitting Holly blue

1551
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:52,448

1553
01:39:53,984 --> 01:39:56,032
Very very lucky

1554
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:57,312
Okay

1555
01:39:57,568 --> 01:39:59,616
So that's what I can bubbles look like

1556
01:40:02,432 --> 01:40:03,712
There is

1557
01:40:03,968 --> 01:40:08,320

And I'm going to

1562
01:40:15,488 --> 01:40:20,864
Show you a computer program that will make another of these perfect sample for you right now

1563
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:31,616
That is a piece of software written by

1564
01:40:32,384 --> 01:40:35,968
Stop drop and Wilson do I choose the heroes of exact time playing

1565
01:40:36,224 --> 01:40:38,016
And I'm going to start running now

1566
01:40:39,296 --> 01:40:45,440
It's running from the past to the present and that little dog on top right

1567
01:40:45,696 --> 01:40:47,488
The top most

1568
01:40:48,768 --> 01:40:54,912
Say

1569
01:40:57,728 --> 01:41:03,872
I'm what was visualizing hair is no mistake of the ising model but the state of ammo General system called

1570
01:41:04,128 --> 01:41:05,664
The random cluster model

1571
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:07,456
Which is at 8

1572
01:41:07,712 --> 01:41:13,344
Set appointment with edges that are either present or not present between adjacent

1573
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:14,624
Points

1574
01:41:16,416 --> 01:41:17,184
We can then

1575
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:22,560
Take all of those edges and we could show which things are connected to each other and color them different colors

1576
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:25,888
Identified by the color

1577
01:41:26,144 --> 01:41:26,912
And then we can

1578
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:33,056
Randomly taking custody to make it black or white not give us a sample

1579
01:41:33,824 --> 01:41:36,384
So they want done it

1580
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:40,224
I'm in front of your eyes I have created a perfect sample on this

1581
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:45,856
Spring me Lodge it doesn't take very long

1582
01:41:46,112 --> 01:41:46,880
This method

1583
01:41:47,648 --> 01:41:48,160
So

1584
01:41:48,672 --> 01:41:54,816
On the screen tab

1585
01:41:55,072 --> 01:41:57,632
I'm doing it now in the top left-hand corner

1586
01:41:57,888 --> 01:42:03,776
So you can see a bit more would look like if you were seeing this for resolution

1587
01:42:04,032 --> 01:42:05,568
The full resolution version

1588
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:06,848
It's on the website

1589
01:42:10,432 --> 01:42:16,576
Okay then summary what we done today we've talked a lot about running book Behavior as how we would love to get rid of it

1590
01:42:17,088 --> 01:42:23,232
I'll show you some efficient methods for reducing run about Behavior I'll show you some methods for getting rid of the sensitivity to Chris

1591
01:42:23,488 --> 01:42:24,768
Promises

1592
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:26,304
And I told you a little bit

1593
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:28,096
About exact sampling

1594
01:42:28,352 --> 01:42:32,704
Throw some other issues respond to the last lecture someone said

1595
01:42:33,216 --> 01:42:39,360
How do you find the normalizing, and that's the crucial question we would love to know that normalizing constant from any of these problems

1596
01:42:39,872 --> 01:42:46,016
I'm the right illumise literature on very complicated and Counting methods to find cuz I like that

1597
01:42:46,528 --> 01:42:47,808
These must color method

1598
01:42:48,064 --> 01:42:54,208
So his words from literature

The reason so difficult to get the dome light in Compton

1604

Is visualized with a cartoon hat

1605
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:18,016
Imagine that you go to Lake

1606
01:43:18,272 --> 01:43:21,600
And the Lakers going to that the Jacksonville Ikea poke stop

1607
01:43:21,856 --> 01:43:24,416
Imagine you've got some capability

1608
01:43:24,928 --> 01:43:28,512
To move your boat around on the lake and how deep the lake

1609
01:43:28,768 --> 01:43:33,632
He might be trying to draw uniformly distributed python samples from the light

1610
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:40,544
Let's imagine that you have at least told that you've not got the capability to cool up a random point in the lake

1611
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:46,944
Random intense of uniformitarianism the whole volume of the light

1612
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:48,992
Tell me how deep the lake is

1613
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:51,808
If you keep on pulling on that capability

1614
01:43:52,064 --> 01:43:54,624
And you'll complicated light completely

1615
01:43:54,880 --> 01:44:01,024
You will be able to go to randomly chosen point in the volume of water I need to find out how deep for like it

1616
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:06,144
I just have to think about that capability if you go to all of those points

1617
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:07,936
I made it home depot like it

1618
01:44:08,448 --> 01:44:11,264
Does that tell you, water is in Malay

1619
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:12,800
Tonight

1620
01:44:13,824 --> 01:44:16,640
No because you could be in a lake

1628
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:41,984
Not quite so difficult that because that is the amount of water

1629
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:45,056
Dim the lights they have to use other methods

1630

To a distribution that you understand the way you know the volume

1634
01:44:56,064 --> 01:45:00,160
Then you go from that by seeking to stats for the real distribution of Interest

1635
01:45:00,416 --> 01:45:04,000
I did not weigh

1636
01:45:07,072 --> 01:45:10,400
That's all I wanted to say about Adventure

1637
01:45:10,656 --> 01:45:11,680
Are there any questions

1638
01:45:19,872 --> 01:45:21,408
Okay so the question is

1639
01:45:21,664 --> 01:45:24,480
Is at the one-dimensional variable it's like Netflix

1640
01:45:24,736 --> 01:45:26,016
Samantha is

1641
01:45:26,784 --> 01:45:29,856
The problem that you are solving maybe many dimensional

1642
01:45:30,368 --> 01:45:33,440
If you want to sell them any damage no problem with black something

1643
01:45:33,696 --> 01:45:34,976
Then what you would do

1644
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:36,512
Is

1645
01:45:40,096 --> 01:45:41,888
You take your current location

1646
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:44,960
How do you pick a direction to slice in

1647
01:45:45,472 --> 01:45:48,288
It could be any any direction

1648
01:45:49,056 --> 01:45:53,152
As long as your message using the direction doesn't depend on the current location

1649
01:45:53,664 --> 01:45:56,992
Upickit erection and then you say hello

1650
01:45:57,248 --> 01:45:58,272
To be

1651
01:45:58,784 --> 01:46:03,392
The distance along the direction when you operate fly sampling along that line

1652
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,792
Pick a blue point

1653
01:46:10,304 --> 01:46:11,328
This is your new podcast

1654
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:15,168
And then you pick another Direction at random Maybe

1655
01:46:15,424 --> 01:46:21,568
I need you flight something along that

1656
01:46:24,384 --> 01:46:28,224
So that's how you was used by something it's a lot like get something

1657
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:32,064
Which goes along the axes

1658
01:46:33,344 --> 01:46:36,416
If you can use any Massachusetts directions

1659
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:43,072
Taken

1660
01:46:48,448 --> 01:46:49,216
Okay

1661
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:55,104
The question is can you apply exact time playing to continuous value

1662
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:56,896

You have to be very cunning

1665
01:47:01,504 --> 01:47:02,784
But it is possible

1666
01:47:04,576 --> 01:47:05,088
Soul

1667
01:47:05,856 --> 01:47:07,136
Some continuous problems

1668
01:47:07,648 --> 01:47:09,184
Disney exact something

1669
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:15,584
So the critical thing you need is some way of achieving coalescence even though you felt

1670
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:17,888
The number for True Value that one parameter

1671
01:47:18,144 --> 01:47:20,448
Did it have a China at the properties at

1672
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:22,752
Sometimes all of those in

1673
01:47:23,008 --> 01:47:24,800
All of the points in this continuum

1674
01:47:25,056 --> 01:47:31,200
Kodak lens for single value

1675
01:47:36,832 --> 01:47:37,600
It's not easy

1676
01:47:37,856 --> 01:47:43,232
I bet there isn't a huge Liquors we can do Bayesian inference

1677
01:47:43,488 --> 01:47:46,560
That's not being a chief

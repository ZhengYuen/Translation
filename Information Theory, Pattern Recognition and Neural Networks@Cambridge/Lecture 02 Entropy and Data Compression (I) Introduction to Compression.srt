1
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:12,288
Coming last time we discussed reliable communication over unreliable channels

2
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:18,944
I know I did want that we were taking noisy channels and imagining

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:25,344
Fixing up those unreliable channels by putting in and coding system in front of a decoding system

4
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,392
After the channel

5
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:29,696
And

6
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:31,232
We discussed

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,144
A toy example of a noisy Channel 92 binary symmetric Channel which flips a fraction f

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:44,544
And we discussed a couple of simple ways of encoding a couple of simple ways of adding redundancy

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,944
Maybe repetition codes on Van the 7400 code which is a more sophisticated way

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,224
Finding redundancy

11
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:58,880
And we discussed how to decode both and so the ideas Demco deciding redundancy and then

12
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:04,000
Dakota is using inference to try and figure out what happened and cleanup fiera's

13
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:14,752
Allergies to to result that we will prove in due course which is adding one of the most room

14
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:21,152
Century maybe Shannon's noisy Channel coding theorem which says that

15
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:27,552
If you add redundancy in a cunning way you don't actually need to add very much redundancy

16
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:33,440
To be able to achieve arbitrarily low-probability Avera so for the

17
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:39,840
Funniest metric channel that slipping 10% of the bits the boundary between achievable and nanachi food places

18
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:46,240
I'm on this diagram of right and final error probability

19
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:52,640
Great see the capacity which is about 0.53 I'm not saying you only need two

20
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:57,248
Use a rate 1/2 kojo need to 100% redundancy

21
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:03,648
And then you can have a smaller probability that you want so that's amazing I will prove it in a few

22
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,184
Adjust time

23
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:11,328
The first let's discuss where this fits into the the big picture

24
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:22,336
Real data sources are usually redundant themselves so this picture that I

25
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:26,176
Richard you last time we take this awesome we add some redundancy

26
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:32,064
May not be quite the right thing to do if the source we started with already have some redundancy

27
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:38,464
Sorry for example in English text if what we're compressing is English vowels and consonants

28
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,864
With particular frequency to talk on text dependent or not something that we could learn about and exploit

29
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:52,288
And let me show you an example of this here's a piece of English with Progressive

30
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:58,688
Simply increasing fractions of a raised and volunteer projects could help us

31
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:05,088
Read this and if anyone can read it successfully so we can cope with severe Asia

32
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:11,488
Evidence of the original text had redundancy in it so some Jane Austen

33
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:14,048
Navigate reading it for us

34
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:20,960
Condom shopping

35
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:29,408
Musicians Unite

36
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:36,320
Nearly 20 years in the world with very little

37
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:43,488
She was the youngest of the two daughters of a

38
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:47,584
Most affectionate Belgian father and head

39
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:54,240
Mistress of this house

40
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:57,824
Very early.

41
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:01,920
Her mother had died too long ago for her

42
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:02,944
Do you have

43
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:10,368
Decimated thank you so

44
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:16,768
Raise your rates go up to that about one-third of the Conchas are racing this row so

45
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:23,167
Very early. Her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than on

46
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:28,031
Indistinct remembrance of her caresses

47
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:31,103
Aunt

48
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:38,015
And I was getting a bit hot is an illustration just using a human expert

49
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:44,415
The redundancy that you can cope with some arrays it's a rule English text has redundancy so how did

50
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:47,487
Fit in the the big picture

51
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,071
Oops

52
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,679
Here's the correct decoding

53
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,471
Oh well then

54
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:03,615
The big picture

55
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:10,015
In a standard Communication System what we want to do is exploit that redundancies already exists

56
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:16,415
In a real sore and get rid of it and shrink the file so we can press it first and making ID

57
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:22,815
He lies to us that we can then put into the channel coding method that we're discussing last time I had the right sort of her.

58
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:27,167
Tennessee for the channel and coda

59
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:33,823
I thought we discussed last time but we're going to wrap that whole thing inside a compressor and then an uncompressed

60
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:41,503
So going to provide data compression and will spend a few lectures on this topic the conventional way of

61
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:47,903
Doing things it's not essential that you have to do Channel coding those are upside down

62
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:54,303
Ignore ignore it should say

63
00:05:54,559 --> 00:06:00,703
Swift coding

64
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:09,151
So how about compressor

65
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:14,783
Uncompressed

66
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:21,439
And then we'll have the channel code Bianco.

67
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:27,839
That's designed. The rights of redundancy telecommunicator to the noisy Channel

68
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:35,007
Atlanta how to decode up a channel as long as that does a perfect job then

69
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:41,663
Which have what's coming out of

70
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,735
So that's the game plan

71
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:52,671
So we call list so coding or data compression and we want to understand how to do that

72
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,607
In order to discuss compression

73
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:07,007
It may be helpful to think about idealized sources of redundant

74
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:13,407
Data so I can think about confessing things at the idealized and simple and the fish

75
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:17,247
Best example and go to talk about is the bent coin

76
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:28,767
And been calling is going to have an outcome and who can forget looked around comes

77
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:35,167
The outcome lived in an alphabet and the alphabet has to

78
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:41,567
Characters in it wonderful Tales Uncle Ted's and the probabilities

79
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,967
All those two outcomes

80
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,575
Nuggets in San Mateo and a 10% chance

81
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,599
Of a hat

82
00:07:55,391 --> 00:08:01,535
And my notation is alcool a random variable

83
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,071
X

84
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:09,471
On the provisional actiontiles is 0.9 the notation I use in the

85
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,495
Facebook

86
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:14,591
4 random variables

87
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:20,991
Answer the question we want to ask about this redundant source is redundant because

88
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:27,391
We want to understand better if we get

89
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:31,999
File made up of say 1000 outcomes from this source

90
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,559
So we talked about going to passing times

91
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,887
How much information

92
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:42,495
Does that string of outcomes half and

93
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:46,079
How should we go about compressing that string of outcomes

94
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:48,127
And finally

95
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:53,247
What is the smallest possible compressed file size that we should be aiming for

96
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:59,391
I would like to answer this question for any

97
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:05,791
Random variable is just a simple example in general I'll use this notation

98
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:12,191
I'm on some bull which will have a capital f x

99
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:18,591
Three things it's a random variable and alphabet on the pole roof

100
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,359
Fusion

101
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:27,039
A random variable which I'll share with a load

102
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,063
Pace weather

103
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:34,463
A set of possible outcomes

104
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:48,799
Electrical the alphabet A1 A2 A3

105
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:55,199
Hey I will rise the number of the alphabet

106
00:09:55,711 --> 00:10:01,855
A set of probabilities

107
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:14,655
B complex made up of P1 P2

108
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:21,055
K i

109
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:30,271
The probability that X is a

110
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:36,671
I understand the perversities have the properties of them

111
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:42,047
And the Republic was there a

112
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,863
So that's

113
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:50,751
A general sort of random outcomes in which the band coin is one example

114
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,799
And

115
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,847
We're going to discuss

116
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:58,687
I've been calling and some other examples

117
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:04,575
And as we discussed the motor to examine explain this is Shannon's claim

118
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:10,975
That's the right way to measure information content and the right way

119
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:17,375
To say how much should we expect to go to compress things is as follows

120
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:23,775
We're going to define a thing called the Shannon information content

121
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:30,175
The sound information compound open outcome

122
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:42,207
They're all talk about just a single outcome for this General ensemble

123
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:48,607
Why we get the random variable and send that to be the son information content

124
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:55,007
Is it tolls

125
00:11:55,263 --> 00:12:01,407
To run over the probability

126
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:07,039
And we measure that in bits

127
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:13,439
Okay love will never fade Simon says that's the right way

128
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:19,839
Dementia information content when something happens you can say I have gained wrist motion

129
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:26,239
Summation that measure of information content by looking at the probability

130
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:32,639
Log 1 over it what does that look like so if you tell me what the probability of your

131
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:39,039
The outcome was P Shannon is same

132
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:45,439
Is biggest for the really improbable outcomes

133
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:51,839
I'm small list the things that was sitting about in fact if something was definitely going to happen if a

134
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:58,239
Zero information content if it has a probability of 1/2

135
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,615
Information content of one b****

136
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:09,759
If something happens that has a progressive 0.9

137
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:16,159
Like for example getting a tail from a coin

138
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,207
Fat Scott

139
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:29,471
That's kind of information content of Love vase to 107.9 which is now

140
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:35,871
Northpoint 15 so Shannon says whenever you got a telephone event calling you've gained 15

141
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:42,271
Hundreds events

142
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:50,463
We got Love by to want over there

143
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:54,815
Bits which is 3.3

144
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,351
Fix

145
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:05,823
Okay so he says every had everyone in this file on the screen

146
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,895
Three and a bit bits of information content

147
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:17,087
So he's cleaning this is the right way to measure information content it's the compressed file

148
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:22,719
Length that we should aspire to someone we invent compression systems

149
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,511
H

150
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:30,911
All facts is

151
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,191
Chicken breast

152
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:38,591
Find the lengths to which we should aspire

153
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:56,767
Okay so that Shannon's playing and I'll carry on Cooling

154
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:03,167
The Shannon information content until you're convinced of that and then I'll stop

155
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:09,567
I noticed the information content because it really is the right way to measure

156
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,359
Information

157
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:17,759
Okay let's not give ourselves

158
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:21,343
What should we do

159
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:27,231
Let's just make some observations about the

160
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:30,047
Shannon information content

161
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,143
Notice

162
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:38,495
Front wall

163
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:44,895
The Shannon information content is additive

164
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:48,223
For independent random variables

165
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:54,623
Okay

166
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,951
At your asking

167
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:04,351
What do I mean by this okay this was really short on for an outcome so I put it on

168
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:10,751
Clash of the said H equals something

169
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:17,151
I'll try and be fairly familiar with notation but if you get two broke down in

170
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:23,551
Innovation that it's no fun anymore so I hope that will clear enough without being too

171
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:27,647
Okay suck

172
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:35,839
This mission content information content is additive for independent random variables

173
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:42,239
For example if I ask why

174
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:48,639
Come from a single girl is a pair of random variables x y

175
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:55,039
What's the probability distribution for X Y is p of x x t r y

176
00:16:55,295 --> 00:17:01,439
For all apps on Weinbach the definition of independent

177
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:20,639
Temperature Townsend content of the Ryman

178
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:27,039
Umberto's take your own particular values and I'll use a short time until age of X and Y that means the outcome

179
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:33,439
Whatever exes and why being whatever it is is love ways to want over the phone

180
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,999
Palessi

181
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,535
Hope

182
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:43,935
Outcome which is low base 2

183
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:50,335
Plus no pictures by substituting

184
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:56,223
Independent property in half and using the way loved what

185
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,759
A cat

186
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:04,159
So for example if I get time I've been calling on.

187
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:09,791
That acts and if Y is open the door and find out if it's raining or not

188
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:15,423
And I tell you the past that's why I tell you stay to be calling on whether it's raining

189
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:22,591
32 variables that you probably believe are independent on this so it makes sense that the amount of information

190
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:26,687
And I'm getting you if I tell you that I'm single famously

191
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,735
Title. It's not raining

192
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:35,903
Is the same as the information you would have got it separately I told you about one random variable and the other one

193
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:42,303
Bible which already skipped over that

194
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:48,703
Is that the information content Shannon information content is biggest for improbable outcomes

195
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:11,231
Okay let's not Define

196
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:16,607
Another quantity

197
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:24,287
You have improved this is the right way to measure information yet we'll get some examples in about 1

198
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:27,359
But let's just assume it is

199
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:34,015
I'm looking for him then to find another another quantity which is going to be

200
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:40,415
Pickled the entropy this is a property of neon

201
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:46,815
What is the average Shannon

202
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,863
Information content

203
00:19:56,543 --> 00:20:02,687
I'm going to like it like this Consul h x

204
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:09,087
We got it by summing over all possible values of the random variable x p of x

205
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:13,695
Log base 2 x

206
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:20,095
And like the X Nation content with cool the units is measured in

207
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,375
Bits

208
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,191
Okay

209
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,543
So

210
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:36,223
Let's have a think about an example to think about these assertions that this is a good. Goodbye

211
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:42,623
These qualities are sensible connotation let's look

212
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:49,535
Dwayne from which I gave you last time to think about and

213
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,095
Let's think about

214
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:59,007
Strategies for solving the waiting problem so please turn to your neighbor now

215
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:03,615
Have a chat about your solutions to the weighing problem

216
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:14,879
Okay so the goal is given

217
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:21,280
12 one of which is known to be a heavy or light

218
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:27,680
Can use this balance as few times as possible and guarantee that we're going to find the old Bull and others have you alive

219
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:34,080
So who's got a strategy that will do.

220
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:39,456
Solving this problem

221
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:46,112
I want you to answer this question my methods needs at most how many Wayans have

222
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:52,512
I think about your method if you are sure that after you use the balance seven times then definitely you will have

223
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:58,912
Guarantee you would have identified double then please answer 7 Etc

224
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:05,312
Hands up if your method is at most 15 or bigger number of Wayne okay

225
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,592
Both

226
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:08,384
11

227
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,432
10

228
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,968
9

229
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:16,064
Hey Brother 7

230
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,880
I Can't Go For That

231
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,672
6

232
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,464
5

233
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:30,912
904

234
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:31,680
3

235
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:40,640
Apologies we had a technical glitch at this point the number of people who could

236
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:41,664
Do

237
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,736
Displaying problem in three rings

238
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:46,528
Was three

239
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:53,184
Well then moved onto was I asked everyone what that strategy was for the first weighing

240
00:22:54,208 --> 00:23:00,352
And choices are that you can weigh six against six leaving none of the balls on the table

241
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:03,936
One-person show started first playing

242
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:08,544
Or you can have five against five leaving two on the table that wasn't

243
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:15,200
Said you could wait full bolt against for leaving for on the table 20 people chose

244
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:20,576
Both of you can have three against 306 on the table one person shows that

245
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:25,696
Two against two leaving tables on the table for One Bowl against one

246
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:28,256
Ben 10 balls on the table

247
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:34,912
How to identify the possible options as the first playing

248
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:39,520
I didn't ask the question what would be today

249
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:41,824
If you want to get the most information

250
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,384
On average how have your first wedding

251
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,200
Maybe you should put take the first weighing

252
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:51,552
Search for the outcome of that way has the biggest possible entropy

253
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:57,952
I'm up we're about to do now is go through each of those six possible cases and work out what the entropy

254
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,256
Is the outcome

255
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,792
If you choose

256
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,840
Two example way

257
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:07,168
Six against six masopust Casino Disco

258
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,640
Let's backtrack and let's imagine that we weigh six against six

259
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:20,992
Then the possible outcomes when weighing six against six

260
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,296
Rest

261
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,832
Best

262
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,136
Miss

263
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:34,560
So that's an alphabet probabilities of these three outcomes anyone

264
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,632
Hasta Raha

265
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,424
Okay

266
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:44,032
I'm up the entropy of that provoking distribution

267
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:50,432
Entropy is Anthony Omaha and you get warm

268
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:56,064
Let's make a little nicer that somewhere

269
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,880
If we do six against six

270
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:01,952
Then the first outcome is this

271
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,000
Wonlex

272
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:05,792
Okay

273
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:08,608
5ft 5 wasn't very popular

274
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:12,704
But if we hadn't gone with five against five

275
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:20,128
Then what's the probability that it would have balance

276
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:25,248
552 on the table

277
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:30,368
What's the probability that have come

278
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,952
1:6

279
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,768
One sec y16

280
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:46,496
Okay so

281
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:52,896
It will balance if one of these balls on the table is field goal and got two of the Bulls out of a total of 12

282
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:56,992
2/12 * which is 1/6

283
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:02,880
And by symmetry the remaining probability the shed out there any 10:12

284
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:06,464
His equally between ac512

285
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,768
Red high tops

286
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:13,376
Find the entropy of the outcome in this case

287
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,680
If we write five against five

288
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:22,336
I have worked out for you in advance is 1.48 bits

289
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:24,896
Curious that no one went for that

290
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,456
But

291
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:31,552
What else could we do well we could weigh four against four

292
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:33,344
If we weigh

293
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:35,648
4 against 4

294
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:40,768
Then what's the probability that it will balance

295
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:42,816
Somewhere else

296
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:54,592
15 McCants for 12 because of a balance if one of the four bowls on the table

297
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,640
Table is the audible

298
00:26:56,896 --> 00:27:01,760
An intervening 8/12 to split

299
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,856
Okay so full vs 4

300
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:09,440
Gives you the entropy all

301
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:16,096
Which is log base 2 or 3 which is 1.5

302
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:16,864
5/8

303
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,984
If we were a three against three

304
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:27,872
Then what's the probability that

305
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,664
Left 6 on the table

306
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:32,992
What's the preventative Sr cam

307
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:34,784
Huh

308
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,624
Okay I'm sorry I must be across a chance of each of these

309
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,184
When you work out the entropy

310
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,792
You got 1/2 * 2 + 1/2 * 1

311
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:49,632
Which is 1.5

312
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:59,104
I'm so let me fill in the remaining for girls easy way to get to the Indians be as 1.25

313
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:04,224
Life bits if you a 1 against Plum and Sparrow 0.8

314
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:04,992
2

315
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:09,088
So something you could have done

316
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:14,720
If we believed in Shannon was just pay for these different possible

317
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,256
Take

318
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:21,632
Let's just go with the one that maximizes the information content and that would have sent us to

319
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,424
Best choice rich

320
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,216
Maybe after some Court

321
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:27,008
Many of you have

322
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,288
Erotica

323
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,592
Good

324
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:33,920
Alright let's go ahead and go with that choice

325
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,832
And so we've got some balls now which we could say I'll probably like supposed to be like those who like

326
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:45,440
Dfsr come here cuz

327
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:50,560
What should we call lease

328
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,864
He's a good Bulls G

329
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:54,656
Okay

330
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,448
So

331
00:28:56,704 --> 00:29:01,568
That's one possible thing that could happen the Buffalo out, assuming away four against four

332
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,128
Left side goes up

333
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,920
Right side goes down

334
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:09,248
I will go full bolt on the table which mean I know a good bull

335
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:15,904
So if you'd like to make a suggestion let's go bunch of suggestions of what we would do next if this

336
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,672
Hair

337
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:19,744
Webbie outcome of a CNA

338
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:21,792
And

339
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:26,912
Let's get some suggestions what we do next

340
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:03,776
Okay

341
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:05,824
He'd like to suggest

342
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,592
Something

343
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:07,872
Golf

344
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:18,112
We're a walk against the other group

345
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,160
Okay

346
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:26,816
Okay so you could wave full Goods against

347
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:30,656
The fool possibly lights

348
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:39,360
Okay so Justin number 2

349
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:43,712
Tell tell me again what's your suggestion now

350
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,040
Okay

351
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:00,864
Okay let's not leave to get to all the reasoning we're going to have to work with that that's a nice suggestion about any other suggestion

352
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,168
Think about it

353
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,984
Probabilities in due course

354
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:07,520
Yeah

355
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,152
How many

356
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,160
201 lights

357
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,720
I'm outside and then

358
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,120
BMO Harris Android

359
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,656
A light okay

360
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:42,848
Right side in this case we're leaving on the table I possibly light and full possibly heavy dudes

361
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:46,944
Here you'll suggesting leaving both lights on the table

362
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,224
How long will it be

363
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,248
The goods

364
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,808
Okay

365
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:58,208
That's a nice suggestion let's now have I think about me and think about the possible

366
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:00,768
Things that could happen

367
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:01,792
Suck

368
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:06,656
If we were together this strategy as a second way

369
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:10,240
All the goods on one side and all the puppy light on the other

370
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,264
Then

371
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,544
What could happen

372
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,664
Could it look like that

373
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:18,944
Could that happen

374
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:21,504
Could the right hand side go down

375
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,160
No

376
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,440
Why not

377
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:42,752
So these ones are all possible allies

378
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:47,360
Are there any way that's like your go down giving it the left hand

379
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:49,152
Bulldog good is it

380
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,432
One of these people is

381
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:53,248
Noble I'm heavy but we already know that snow

382
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,576
Possible pizza guys can only be available at the light

383
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,624
This has probability 0

384
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:03,488
Is it possible they could balance

385
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:06,816
Hernia

386
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,144
It's one of the heavy heavy guys

387
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,192
What the probability of that being the case

388
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,240
Haha okay

389
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:16,288
What's the probability of

390
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,848
What happening

391
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:21,152
Haha

392
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:22,688
Okay

393
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:27,808
So that the probability distribution whose entropy is wrong with it

394
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:31,904
Okay let's talk through this one app

395
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,032
Okay

396
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:54,688
It's an isometric situation isn't it let's talk about the symmetric outcome

397
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:56,224
Havit balancing

398
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,696
Dakota

399
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:08,000
What you ate

400
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:12,096
Because if you'll believe on these two then it will balance

401
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,656
Okay

402
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:20,288
So by 7 treat the remaining probability has to be

403
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:23,104
Split between the oven.

404
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,128
Create

405
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,664
3x

406
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,968
For example

407
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:30,016
This could happen

408
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:33,600
This guy is y'all bull

409
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:35,904
Under the light of the normal

410
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:39,744
If one of the either of those is

411
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,768
Pitbull

412
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:42,304
And the heavy

413
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:43,840
Hi-Tech

414
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:46,144
So that's another

415
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:51,776
Possible action and its Provo distribution

416
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,104
We could

417
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:57,152
Y33 lights

418
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:02,784
What's the probability that this will

419
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,672
Balance

420
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,072
Phyllite

421
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:17,888
They cost us 550 old balls

422
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:22,752
Nobody left on the table and if any of them is killed or and it's kind of balance

423
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:25,568
What's the probability that

424
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,616
It will do

425
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:29,408
Vest

426
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:32,992
Turn on left and right

427
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:44,768
What's half of 5/8

428
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:48,608
I got is 3/8 and 0 is the probability of getting this

429
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,656
How to come here

430
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:56,032
Big house there's no way that the guys could be heavier than the good

431
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:56,800
Guys

432
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:02,688
Right so did a whole bunch of personal things we can do and every one of them is leading to a different

433
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:04,224
Probability distribution

434
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:06,784
His Wang prolifics mission

435
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,320
Head and

436
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:16,000
I miss long as I don't repeat that is actually a little bit less than one bit

437
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,168
This one has an entropy

438
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:26,240
Bigger than wombats

439
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:29,312
And I wonder if I can

440
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,360
What it is

441
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:37,504
I've mislaid the actual value or it

442
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,808
But it's actually a little bit bigger

443
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:42,112
Find 1.5

444
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:44,672
Fitz

445
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:48,000
Do you have any other suggestions of

446
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:53,632
Possible things you could do at this stage given that this was with us out come up with

447
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:55,168
Any other suggestions

448
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:56,960
Yeah

449
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,128
OK Google

450
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,688
Against

451
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,992
Three like I'm heavy

452
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:12,064
Set

453
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:17,184
That could balance it could

454
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:20,256
That way I could guy

455
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,072
This way

456
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:31,008
Right we left on the table a life dude on three possibly heavy duty

457
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:35,104
So what's the probability that it's going to balance

458
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,064
Temperature

459
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:50,976
Because if any of these full possibly old guys is the other guy and it's going to be

460
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:52,512
All right

461
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,816
What's the probability

462
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:57,632
That is all day

463
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,472
The right hand side down

464
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:04,544
Landslide on left side up

465
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,104
1/8

466
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:09,408
Because the only way that could happen

467
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:11,456
Is it available is this

468
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:13,248
Ridiculizar put in

469
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,808
3/8

470
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:18,880
But as yet another

471
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,536
Do you think this is.

472
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:28,864
The biggest entropy sofa

473
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,168
Will these options

474
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,448
So we can just

475
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:36,032
Imagine trusting Shannon if I give you

476
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:39,616
An alphabet of size I

477
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:47,808
And I asked you do you want me to up to Pi you got a free choice

478
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:50,624
All those probabilities

479
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,000
And your goal is to maximize

480
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,280
Hfx

481
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,328
What

482
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:01,376
Rudy Maxa

483
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:03,680
Maximizes

484
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,032
Banfi

485
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,104
I'll talk to you later

486
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,528
Okay

487
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,576
That's what math problem

488
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:24,672
What's the answer how do you maximize sum of p i

489
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:30,304
Log base 2 of Pi with respect to the probability that Caffey

490
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,352
What to do with B

491
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:39,776
Goats

492
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:45,408
Uniform place at all of the vehicle to Wong over

493
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:46,944
Hi

494
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:49,504
Okay so if I give you

495
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:51,040
Some cake

496
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:52,832
And I say

497
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:56,672
This cake consists of eight pieces

498
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:00,768
I need three children

499
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:09,472
And you've got to share out the cake as bad as a brother become between the three children

500
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,752
Cut up the pieces

501
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:17,920
What's the best way to do that you give zero

502
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:24,576
Tuan Child full pieces of Honor for $20 which is what we'll be doing here

503
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:31,232
Yeah well that's the rule if you do have to give all the cake to children

504
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:32,512
So

505
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:36,608
Is that the most beautiful way of showing the cake I know

506
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:40,704
3 to 3.

507
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,496
Looking quite beautiful isn't it

508
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:49,408
Long peaceful on 403 for Nova

509
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:54,016
Unknown suggested a strategy but it's a very common

510
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:59,648
Things for people to suggest that you weigh something against something that gives rise to the probabilities

511
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:04,768
42828 sets of 8

512
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,840
Popular thing to do and my guess would be

513
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:12,960
Quite a few of you who chose for Against full

514
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:14,752
How's your first way

515
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,568
Maybe you'll next that had

516
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,872
Hey choice of Wang

517
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:22,176
That she gives rise to this soda distribution

518
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,712
Should I give an example

519
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:24,736
What's an example

520
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:28,064
Maybe I should have asked for another all the tests just something

521
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:30,880
Someone suggested we just see if it was

522
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:35,488
Hhll

523
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,328
2 inches on one side to alchemilla

524
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:43,168
Brilliant

525
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,216
Santana

526
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:51,360
Okay

527
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:55,967
I'm going to slightly change your suggestion actually

528
00:41:56,991 --> 00:42:03,135
Cuz I think if we put old we have even once I know the puppy lights on the other side then one outcome definitely

529
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:08,255
Lang leav if I do it

530
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:12,351
All right I'm like 2 inches in 2 hours on the table so balancing

531
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:14,143
Has a probability of

532
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,423
All right

533
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:19,007
And then by symmetry fill the time comes

534
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:25,407
Have a problem tablecloth reach full

535
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:28,223
I'm too for another that's very fair isn't it

536
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:32,831
How can I activate 1.5 bits

537
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:39,231
His Bonita ID

538
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:40,767
How about we trust Shannon

539
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:47,167
I wish I'd not going to do that because that has uniform and Channing says he should go for a uniform probability distribution

540
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:52,031
I think this is short-circuiting having to think huh you just say let's use the entropy

541
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,359
Do this

542
00:42:56,895 --> 00:43:01,247
So do anyway that maximizes the entropy

543
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:04,063
This one doesn't perfectly maximize the entropy

544
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:09,439
Cuz you can't exactly got a uniform distribution when things come in 8

545
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:12,767
Personifies

546
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:13,791
Right

547
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:19,679
And if you do go ahead and do that and then use the same method your next wedding

548
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:24,031
Pick an action that still gives you

549
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:26,591
The most possible expected information

550
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:28,383
He'll be done in three ways

551
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,711
Side

552
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:35,551
This is our first success of using

553
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:37,343
Shannon's Hardware

554
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:44,255
I want prove it to you but feel free to go ahead and find you can find break it and put bandage on it for this

555
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:50,911
If you want you can go to this this post have you doing this

556
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:55,007
What you find is Shannon will get you that in three ways

557
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,031
All right

558
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:57,311
Christian death

559
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:06,015
Hi

560
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:17,023
Good sir the comment is

561
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:23,679
You could imagine a world in which you could do an experiment that tells you all about the colors of the bulls and that's irrelevant

562
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:26,495
Finding which one is the the the heavy one

563
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,799
And so this tragedy

564
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:31,103
Isn't necessarily going to work

565
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:37,503
Because in not so the world race I hope choose the option that gives you met some information content what you going to do

566
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:41,599
Grab one of those old televisions and switch it on instead of whole black and white stuff

567
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:47,999
Is Eagle Eye on the screen because I have a lot of information, so you're right it's going to be relevant information

568
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:54,399
I didn't this particular case the only information you can generate is relevant information

569
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,167
We were lucky

570
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:56,703
So

571
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:57,727
Yes

572
00:44:57,983 --> 00:45:03,615
This is a strategy for solving problem puzzles like this

573
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:08,735
You really do need information about what's relevant and that's the real

574
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:09,759
Real message

575
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:12,575
Okay any other questions yes

576
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:44,319
Okay that's a very good question so you could imagine choosing a first weighing that shining says brilliant

577
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:49,695
You got lots of information from that but it got you into some sort of dead-end so have a greedy strategy

578
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:53,791
That isn't the best overall strategy because your first choice

579
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:57,375
May it be nice and informative but then you're stuck

580
00:45:57,887 --> 00:46:01,215
Yes very just puzzles with I like that so

581
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:07,615
I'm not telling you to always use a greedy specialty I'm not saying always make your first measurement

582
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:11,455
It's just an interesting

583
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:15,039
This puzzle I got you that a three-ring

584
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:20,159
So a beautiful thing about information theory is it can make your life much easier just have

585
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:23,999
A well-defined objective function that can be a very helpful guide

586
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:26,047
Do what you do me right

587
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:30,399
In general problems like this can have difficulties if you go through a greedy

588
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:31,423
Strategy

589
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:32,959
So do take care

590
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:36,031
All right I never questions

591
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:39,359
Sorry

592
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:45,759
Let's now go back to our idealized

593
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:47,551
Source that we

594
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:50,879
Talked about at the beginning of coin

595
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:53,183
The Bank coin comes up heads

596
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,463
10% of the time

597
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:56,767
Entails 90% of the time

598
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:58,047
And

599
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:00,095
I'm going to give you a

600
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:02,399
Possible to think about

601
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:04,959
But next time

602
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:07,007
So

603
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:13,919
I could have been declining Lottery on his way to Ben Cohen Lottery which is rather like the national lottery

604
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:19,039
About to get the winning ticket instead of using a little Bulls

605
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:25,183
Android symbol that we just take a single been calling on we talk that a thousand times

606
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:32,095
So the outcome of that thousand long sequence of Tulsa is is a string

607
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:35,423
X1 X2 upto XN

608
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:41,567
I'm sorry as an example of a possible outcomes at my house earlier ones or

609
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:48,223
Know before they draw that out come by tossing the coin you kind of go to the

610
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:49,247
Lottery

611
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:51,295
Hot and buy tickets

612
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:56,415
An H Ticket available to you each ticket is a great long string of

613
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:58,463
Zeros and ones ordered

614
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:02,559
Okay so you can buy the old zeros ticket if you want

615
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:05,375
You can buy any of the truth The Impossible tickets

616
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:11,519
One once I want has decided tickets that buying

617
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:14,591
If you own the tickets

618
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:20,479
Has x on it where X is the outcome that actually happened then with a million times a billion times

619
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:21,759
Inflation

620
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:23,807
You got a million pounds

621
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:30,207
And anyone who has that ticket gets a billion times right so it's not sad you don't need to worry about sharing with

622
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:30,975
A lot of people

623
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:32,511
Sup

624
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:37,887
The question of why you think about the next time is

625
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:44,799
If a mafia boss said haha we are going to take advantage of this Lottery we're going to ensure that we get a large amount of

626
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:46,335
We're going to get a billion times

627
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:49,407
I will give you Matthew funds

628
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:52,479
You must go in by 11 tickets

629
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:54,015
To ensure that we win a billion

630
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:55,551
Which

631
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:56,575
Tickets

632
00:48:56,831 --> 00:49:00,927
Would you buy so the rule from a Mafia Boss is

633
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:02,975
I have a 99% chance

634
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:03,999
Of winning

635
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,279
The lottery

636
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:08,863
A minimizing talk to the mafia boss cuz you don't want to rip it off

637
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:11,935
Which tickets would you buy from the ticket

638
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:12,703
Selling

639
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:13,471
Hot

640
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:18,079
Take that question one way ticket to buy your lunch at 9% chance of winning

641
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:21,919
And secondly how many tickets would you then have board

642
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:27,295
Alright please express your answer in the form 2 to the power something

643
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:32,415
So that's a task for you to do before the next lecture

644
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,463
And

645
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:40,863
I'd also like to mention purple homework you could be doing if

646
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:47,263
This world a course for real with your Visions on the game since I thought I would be recommending the following exercise

647
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:49,567
I hope you'll find them fun

648
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:56,223
The first exercise we would do for supervision is please invent your own error-correcting code for the

649
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:59,551
Binary symmetric Channel this is going back to the previous left turn now

650
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:01,599
Remember the binary symmetric Channel

651
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:05,439
Which looked at representing codes we looked at the Hamming code

652
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:07,487
I'd like you to invent

653
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:11,327
Another code for the binary symmetric Channel

654
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:14,655
And invented decoding algorithm for your code

655
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:18,495
And estimate the probability of era of the decoding

656
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:20,543
Encoding system that you define that

657
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:24,383
And if you don't like the binary symmetric Channel

658
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:30,783
Feel free to invent your own channel and invent a code for that channel make a problem and be creative

659
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:31,807
Come up with some solutions

660
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:37,439
I'm in the book there some more exercises wish you might want to do which I listed up that

661
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:42,559
I'm finally I'd like you to read no honey chapter one which was last week's lecture notes

662
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:44,863
But chapters 2 and full

663
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:51,519
Next time we'll look at a few more examples and we will try and RAM home

664
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:57,919
The View that the Shannon information content really is the right way to measure information content

665
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:00,479
Thanks for coming see you next week

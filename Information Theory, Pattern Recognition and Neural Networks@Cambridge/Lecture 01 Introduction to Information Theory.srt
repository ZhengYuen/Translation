1
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:12,032
Okay welcome everyone thank you very much for coming to this the first lecture

2
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:14,080
On a course called

3
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:16,384
Information Theory pattern recognition

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,176
And neural networks

5
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:22,016
The first lecture is an introduction to information Theory

6
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:33,280
Information theory was invented by Claude Shannon to solve communication problems

7
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:34,816
And

8
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:36,864
The fundamental problem

9
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:41,472
That Shannon defined was the task of reliable communication

10
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:43,520
An unreliable Channel

11
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:08,352
Sorry that's a fundamental problem and I'll give some examples

12
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:12,192
All right now

13
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:22,176
So some examples of channels

14
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:29,088
1 channel by using right now is the channel that goes from my voice to you

15
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:32,416
And the medium is

16
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:40,096
I know the channel that we may be using is a channel it goes for my eyes up to

17
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,656
Bits of our nervous system

18
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:48,544
And that the medium is so bags of cytoplasm intellect limp lump impulses

19
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:54,944
Another example of a channel that we're all carrying around with us is DNA about

20
00:01:55,968 --> 00:02:02,112
10 to the 13 copies of our genome on Boris and

21
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:08,512
And every time one of those bells replicates and two copies of the gene

22
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:14,912
Repeat that 40 times and you've gone from an egg to a human being and maybe I'll

23
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,192
The Next Generation

24
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,496
And

25
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:25,152
Another example is the spacecraft baby Mars Rover or something like that

26
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:31,808
And I'm 10 on Earth how to use the vacuum

27
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,368
Transmission medium

28
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,392
And

29
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:40,768
Send signals to the miles and make it back

30
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:47,168
Signal settings of the channel that can go in both directions

31
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:54,336
And another example it is a phone line so you maybe have a

32
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,640
Copper wire

33
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,944
If you're old fashions

34
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,992
Connecting One phone

35
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,064
Turn off the phone

36
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:15,328
Another example is a disk drive so the medium is some sort of film

37
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,424
Hannah standard

38
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,704
Hard drive

39
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:24,032
And in that destroying

40
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:31,456
You store a message which might be the file and use

41
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,224
Send it

42
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,760
Do yourself

43
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:39,136
At another time so many of these towns go from one place to another place

44
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:45,536
One place to another place you can have channels that go from one place to they strive to the same place but

45
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:51,680
The time and was still trying to communicate a message from that one location to another location

46
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:58,080
And all of these channels have in common with property

47
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:02,944
That the received signal isn't identical to the transmitted

48
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,224
Signal

49
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,760
So

50
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:10,368
Because of noise or

51
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:15,232
Other processes I receive signal

52
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,768
Is Maybe

53
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,583
Approximately equal to

54
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,399
The transmitted signal

55
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,751
But we've got some noise

56
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,543
Added as well

57
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,591
Maybe some of these channels

58
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:36,991
Maybe there's no relationship no simple equality relationship but told you just have to message

59
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:43,391
How to receive signal depending on the transmission signal in some way for a toy Channel

60
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:47,743
Northeast signal by adding some sort of noise

61
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,535
And

62
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:55,935
In most of these applications we might say that's bad news because we would really like reliable communication we would like

63
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:00,287
I'd like to be able to deduce the receiver precisely what the

64
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,591
Irish middle transmitted

65
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,383
Signal was

66
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,919
So

67
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,735
We would like

68
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:12,831
Communication systems

69
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:16,927
Received message

70
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,863
Is equal to

71
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,935
Message message

72
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:33,567
That would make for a better phone call about the disk drive

73
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,151
How better communication between Electra

74
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,687
And audience

75
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,623
So imagine that

76
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:53,535
What trying to achieve this goal was trying to make a reliable Communication System what sort of approach

77
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,839
Kids could we go for what Solutions are there

78
00:05:56,095 --> 00:06:02,239
Well we can tops categorize solutions to this go into a

79
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,847
Eva that physical Solutions

80
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:16,831
Where you throw away the lines you just drive and replace it by a better one that's more expensive

81
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:23,231
Maybe you take your couple wires and you put better insulation on them

82
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,767
Do you use

83
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:30,655
Dakota magnetic field you add cooling so you change the physics to reduce the noise

84
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,191
Cyber physical Solutions

85
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:38,847
Open System Solutions

86
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:45,247
The idea of a system solution is we accept the lousy Channel as it is

87
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:51,647
Encoding and decoding systems around that channel to turn it into a reliable chat

88
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:58,559
But this is a much more exciting approach in the physical approach physics is exciting to but the system approach except

89
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:03,423
Unreliable system as it is and transforms it into a reliable

90
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,447
System

91
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:20,063
And that's what information theory is about we're going to be taking Souls messages

92
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,951
I saw his message which might School s

93
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:32,607
Is going to be put through an N Kota system and then Kota which we will Design

94
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:38,751
Encoda will spit out the transmission

95
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:39,775
Tea

96
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:44,127
This coded transmission then gets sent

97
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,455
Have the channel

98
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,439
What channel will do its thing

99
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:00,255
Aladdin oil lamps

100
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:07,679
And then look at a received

101
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,495
Message

102
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,871
Which is going to be a corrupted version of this coded message

103
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:31,743
But then we can have another system in systems going to be cold at Dakota

104
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,303
Invent last two

105
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,607
The Dakota

106
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,167
Will try and come up with a guest

107
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:43,263
PS4s with a half on Top Hat meaning guess

108
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,335
What's going on here

109
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:51,199
Bianco de is going to be some sort of system that adds

110
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,759
Redundancy

111
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,575
I will think about that

112
00:08:56,831 --> 00:09:02,975
Will detail in a moment and then the Dakota makes use of this noon system for adding

113
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:05,535
Redundancy to try to infer

114
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,607
T & N

115
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:11,167
What if you like both the source message

116
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,191
And end

117
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:16,287
So the decoder is going to be a system for inferring

118
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,567
And

119
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,103
And

120
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:28,575
Okay let's give ourselves a toy model to think about

121
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:33,183
The Playmobil that will work with for a while

122
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,463
It's cold

123
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,511
The binary symmetric Channel

124
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:42,655
To Binary symmetric Channel

125
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,591
Adult an input

126
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:55,711
And we'll idealliance and assumed that that input is a

127
00:09:55,967 --> 00:10:02,111
0 or 1 but you get to choose each time you use the channel is it a 0 or 1

128
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,135
You sent

129
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,183
And then

130
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:10,047
What comes out is ultherapy or 0 or 1

131
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,863
And we're going to assume

132
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:19,263
That the probability that what comes out is what you put in

133
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,799
Is 1 - F

134
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,359
90%

135
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:36,415
Find the probability that it is not what you put in

136
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,951
Is

137
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,511
For example 10%

138
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:44,607
Whenever you put in a zero cuz it 10% chance of one will come out

139
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:49,471
With a 90% chance is there a will come out and symmetrically

140
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:53,567
Dell way round if you put in a wall and there's a 90% chance you could have worn out

141
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,335
At Petra

142
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:57,151
That's the binary symmetric Channel

143
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:04,575
That's probably very few channels in the real world but all the binary symmetric Channel but it's a nice simple my voltage

144
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:08,415
Discuss that has all the essential properties that we need

145
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,719
To study of information Theory

146
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:17,119
So we can think of this as a model for a disk drive let's say you've made your new startup companies

147
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:23,519
Cambridge blue disc drive and you make your first purchase like this drive using your new invention

148
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:28,383
Technology and attested and you find it flips 10% of the best

149
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:42,719
Is that useful destroying for let's just have a quick think let me ask you question the long hair

150
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,303
Question 1

151
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,607
Try again

152
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:55,775
Okay

153
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,335
?

154
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:06,783
A file of 10000 bits is stored on this disk drive

155
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:20,095
It's stored on a disk drive that flips

156
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,655
10% of the bits

157
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,239
Let's read

158
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,871
Assuming that f is .1

159
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:38,527
Assuming that each b****** independently either flipped on Netflix

160
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,855
Roughly

161
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,647
How many bits

162
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,439
Puppet

163
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,279
Money

164
00:12:56,447 --> 00:13:02,591
Iflix and I'd like you to discuss this weekend and give it

165
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:06,687
In the form roughly this many plus or minus

166
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,223
This money

167
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,807
Does everyone understand the question

168
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:17,695
Okay please talk to your neighbor and then we'll see what numbers go in here

169
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:26,911
Number flip

170
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:35,615
1000 plus or minus how many

171
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,943
Debating okay

172
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,503
Anyone else ae1000plus mice

173
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,063
Plus I minus

174
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,111
100

175
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,671
+ - 900

176
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,327
Tennessee

177
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:59,423
I got a few answers that

178
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:03,263
Who said who wants to give a reason for their answer

179
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,799
So anyone who gave an answer

180
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,079
Reason

181
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,503
900 Sam's Club

182
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,159
3900

183
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,231
Yeah wife us- 900

184
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:33,215
The date of the actual good cuz he doesn't need to understand things if you got the title book

185
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,751
I wanted to take the book side

186
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:45,759
Okay and you're looking at the variance of what

187
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:55,231
Binomial distribution

188
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:59,583
So you look up the binomial distribution

189
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,143
And it's what I mean

190
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:07,775
All enzymes pyp hair is f

191
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:15,967
I just got a variance event EQ IQ is the other thing

192
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:22,623
All right take a look at it and then you need to know what variant means and how that relates to well roughly.

193
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:26,207
- 1000 + - 1

194
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:31,839
10005.1 mm the variances 900

195
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:38,239
But what does that mean the meaning of the variance it's the square of the standard deviation

196
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,543
Service is

197
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:46,175
The square of the standard deviation you take the square root of it which is

198
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:51,551
Sissy that tells you roughly how many bits either way

199
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:57,951
Hillary Clinton not a binomial distribution is pretty much the only bit of mathematics you need to know

200
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:04,351
It's coarse and I do encourage you to review the binomial distribution and get good at working with it because

201
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:10,751
Use it over and over in this topic and another topics in information Theory as well

202
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:17,151
Okay so we have an answer 1000 +

203
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:23,551
Thanks to miss the binomial the inventor of the distribution that says his name

204
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:29,439
Okay so we've got high disk drive

205
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,999
We launched the company

206
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:37,887
And are we going to have a happy customer when we sell the first just drive

207
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,191
Any opinions

208
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,007
No Lie

209
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:50,431
It is slightly too many flips isn't it if someone storing important information

210
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:53,503
Question 2

211
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:57,855
To have a salable this drive

212
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:02,719
Salable 1GB

213
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:06,047
Describe

214
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,191
If it were a disk drive

215
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:18,591
That's a binary symmetric Channel How small would it have to be for you to be able to make a successful

216
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,687
High School

217
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,735
Does the flip probability

218
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,295
Need

219
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:31,135
To me please turn to your neighbor

220
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,927
Can have a chat about this question

221
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,911
Okay

222
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:49,055
Any answers how old do you need to be to have a salable this drive

223
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,615
Have a viable company

224
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,151
Yes

225
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:58,271
10 to - 13 and the other one says

226
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,367
Pentillie

227
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:05,695
10 to -5

228
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:17,727
That's true many people need 20 GB disc about 3 years old

229
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:24,127
Go put a little please

230
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,943
Pretend that you are that's in the past 3 years ago

231
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:35,647
We can redo it for another size of this might be less than gigabytes gigabytes

232
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,695
USB sticks.

233
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:42,047
Okay so trying to make a bootable usb stick

234
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,167
Saint Francis

235
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,567
Temperature

236
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:59,711
10 / 3

237
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:03,039
We got quite a range of ancestor

238
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:07,903
Yeah

239
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,207
No S10

240
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:12,767
Okay so

241
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:19,423
Let's have some explanations from the extremes of the range please

242
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,447
2

243
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:28,383
Where to take the -13 come from what was your

244
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:44,767
Okay every thousand times you fill it online

245
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:50,143
On your judgment was 1000 was was enough

246
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:51,935
Okay

247
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,007
Right

248
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,799
So

249
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,591
2-3 come from

250
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:10,111
Like I said let's redo this calculation let's kick the tires on it a little bit

251
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,903
So

252
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:19,839
Let's imagine that customer is going to use the drive every single day you going to be

253
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:26,239
Sally intensive user that say that they might use the drive to five years because that's stingy and they believe

254
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,799
And sustainable use of resources

255
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:32,639
So let's save. 5 years of use

256
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:38,015
And we're going at a rate of Wong gigabytes today

257
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:44,159
Then the number of bits

258
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:50,559
That will be sent through the channel is 5 years * 1 GB

259
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:53,631
And 1 GB

260
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:59,007
Is 8 * 10 * 9 bits

261
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:05,919
I'm 5 years is 5 x 365

262
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,967
Chase

263
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,783
So that's our number bits

264
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,831
That we want to send

265
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:19,744
And if you multiply that out you got 10 to 13 so very much on the same page

266
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:26,144
Do you want to sell it and say you're expecting a failure within 5 years

267
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,448
Maybe that's not quite good enough we'd like

268
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:32,800
It's be quite unlikely that our first customer will ever complain

269
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:37,920
Yeah so if we want a 1% chance

270
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:44,320
All the disappointment disappointment being that any file a tool

271
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,344
That's messed up

272
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:50,976
Then we need the error probability to be something like 10-15

273
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,888
And if you want your first 1000 customers will be happy then you need to answer 10 - 18

274
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,152
1000 happy customers

275
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:15,808
Pushes you towards one thing tenth of -18

276
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:22,208
And if you talk to the Fitzroy industry and he say what is your industry standard for performance of a disk drive

277
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:25,536
-18

278
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:33,472
For today let's accept 10-15 has a reasonable answer

279
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,800
Stop blaming for

280
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:43,200
Panera probability of 10-15

281
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,504
I would not want to

282
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:51,904
Step back to the diagram I just rubbed off to talk about encode is and Dakota's I'd like to discuss

283
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,440
Ways of adding

284
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:59,840
Redundancy I'll clean the board and if you have a chance we tell her about how could an end CO2 work how could we

285
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,120
Redundancy

286
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,912
Profile

287
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:14,688
Okay

288
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:21,088
No I'm not asking you to give me a name code of it Solstice problem space off I'm just asking

289
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:23,904
Just a tad redundancy

290
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,208
So do we have some ideas behind to add

291
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:27,232
Redundancy

292
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,280
Yeah

293
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,912
Pirate according what does parity coding mean ghost

294
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,568
Okay

295
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:46,944
So we're taking some string of zeros and ones that we want to transmit

296
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,784
Like ice how long is the string that we're going to do the power TV off

297
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:58,976
A bike so maybe take a 8 Bits

298
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:02,048
I was I was looking and then

299
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,400
That's what the sauce came up with and then we add an extra

300
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,192
Parity bit here

301
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:11,008
Who wrote Poppy

302
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,568
And he's the some of those

303
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:20,736
1 2 3 4 5 in 5 example using binary so we right

304
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:24,064
One because one is the famous five okay

305
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,624
It would have been for we would have written 0

306
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:31,488
So that's a parity coding up a way of adding redundancy

307
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,024
Good

308
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,352
Any other ideas for how to add redundancy

309
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:44,288
Repeat things multiple times so we'll have what was the code how many times

310
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:47,872
For example would you want to repeat

311
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:58,368
Okay so we'll cool repetition codes

312
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:02,464
And I'll write out the code

313
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:08,096
We're going to take each bit and I'll resend it will repeat it some number of times

314
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:14,496
So we could send zero and then repeat it twice which I'm going to hit from now on repeating 3 times okay

315
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:16,032
That video

316
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:20,128
3 x + 1

317
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,944
Get send as one or more

318
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,248
I'm Loco with all three

319
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:31,648
And I accept you could pull this repeating it twice because you send it then you repeat it twice but I'm going to pull it repeating it

320
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:34,208
That's my convention

321
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:37,536
And I made one of those that are

322
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:39,584
And this is what it looks like

323
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:44,448
So we've got to find a 10,000 bit on the left and then we repeat it

324
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:50,848
Three times about stereo the debate so the first that is sent after the whole file has been sent

325
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:57,248
Repeat the whole pile three times logically just the same as repeat

326
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,272
8-bit

327
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:04,672
So let's give ourselves a source file and the source file could be the string 01

328
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,952
110

329
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:08,256
Andre transmitted

330
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:15,424
0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1

331
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,448
One one

332
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:21,824
So that's how we encode a file

333
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,176
Let's not give us all some noise and start talking about dakotaz

334
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:28,480
I will stop at the repetition code

335
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:38,720
So let's have a noise back there in the way I'll represent noise is it going to snow for the Packers

336
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,256
If a flip

337
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,816
Because

338
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:50,496
So hear the noise Vector binary symmetric Channel could produce for us

339
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:56,896
And that would that mean that they received that the difference from tea and some

340
00:26:57,152 --> 00:27:03,296
Some of these places

341
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:07,136
11101

342
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,952
So that's how I received letter

343
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:14,048
Did I do that I did

344
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:18,912
The transmission to the noise and I did the addition modulo

345
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:22,240
2 * 1 + 1 + 0

346
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,312
Okay

347
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:29,408
How should we decode this

348
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:32,992
A decoder is a system that reason

349
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,016
I received

350
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,856
File and spits out I guess

351
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,904
4S

352
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,952
Suck

353
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:45,024
In general

354
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,304
How should we

355
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,584
Decode

356
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:50,144
All three have a chat to your neighbor

357
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:03,456
Okay any suggestions of how in general yes or the back

358
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:12,672
Okay so take the mean of each group of three is that what you mean so we read it three of the time

359
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,464
And you say

360
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,584
Is the mean above a closer to 1 or 2 0 okay

361
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,936
Did anyone else have another way of putting the same concept yeah

362
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:30,080
Best of Freehold majority vote Yes

363
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:33,664
We reckon that the sensible Dakota is

364
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,480
The best of n

365
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:37,760
R3

366
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:45,696
And the length of this block of a transmission

367
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,976
Best of free

368
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:51,840
Dakota or majority vote

369
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:56,960
Dakota

370
00:28:57,216 --> 00:29:03,360
All right. If we received their 0-0-0-0 if you received

371
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:07,200
1103 cyclops

372
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:14,112
If we were saving one beside one

373
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:16,160
Do Japan if I make

374
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:24,096
Okay so does eight possible receive that doesn't is what we do according to this

375
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:30,496
Dakota Dakota hair then

376
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:31,776
Juan

377
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,568
Juan

378
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,592
1

379
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:37,664
And what we cannot assist in this case

380
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:40,992
Is that some good things to happen

381
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,784
So here

382
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,320
I flipped because

383
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,600
That was a flip

384
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:49,696
How to train cleaned up because this is the same as this

385
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:51,488
And so that makes us happy

386
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,328
And

387
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,376
Something else has happened

388
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:59,424
Head of a two flips in a block

389
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:04,544
Unless you've been going to want actually an Arab so that's not good

390
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,848
It's not about that

391
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,128
But

392
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:09,408
Fair enough

393
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,504
Maybe this Dakota does improve things

394
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:19,136
So if we apply the majority vote Dakota

395
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,672
This is what we get

396
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:24,000
And if you compare the

397
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,280
Fluffy Mastiff

398
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:27,584
The source file and the

399
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,376
Decoded file that

400
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:36,544
You can say it's improved things we have reduced the probability of era

401
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,592
But it doesn't actually that

402
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:41,408
That's the ten to the minus 15

403
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,688
Progressive Era

404
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:45,248
Not before we

405
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:47,296
Proceed and say

406
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:51,648
How to make besan become better at encoders and decoders

407
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:55,744
I just want to prove this

408
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,768
Intuition

409
00:30:57,024 --> 00:31:00,352
Why is the majority vote Dakota the right Dakota

410
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:07,008
As I said earlier decoding is inference we want to infer

411
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:12,128
What the source

412
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,408
Message

413
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,432
Ross

414
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:20,832
And to do inference we need to use inverse probability

415
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:25,440
I just want to remind you how to invest for the cigarettes because

416
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:31,840
In due course we're going to do slightly more complicated problems while you may not leap to the correct answer quite so

417
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:32,608
Easily

418
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:39,008
So inverse probability needs the rules of probability the rules of probability of the product rule

419
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:45,408
Which says that the probability of two random variables for exempt

420
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:48,736
The Source bit and the received

421
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:55,136
Vector can be written as the probability of s x the probability of

422
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:57,184
Kevin S

423
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:03,840
Play SPF PFS

424
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:10,240
The definition of conditional probabilities if you like it tells you how to get a joint

425
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:13,312
Probability from a marginal probability

426
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:15,360
And a conditional probability

427
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:22,016
Then the other rule of probability and they're already too is the summer rule in the summer

428
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:25,088
How to get a marginal probability

429
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:31,744
By adding up all values of a joint probability

430
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:35,840
P of S&R and I will give you. Are

431
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:36,864
All right

432
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:43,264
So if this is a variable that takes on two values this is

433
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,592
City of s equal 0 & R

434
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:51,200
Plus via vesicles Wong

435
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:54,784
We can use

436
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:59,648
The rules of probability to then tell us how to decode

437
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:13,216
For example if someone tells us off and we want to know how probable alternative values of s

438
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:19,104
That's cool the posterior probability

439
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,576
You got that

440
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:29,856
Bye

441
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:33,440
Taking the two versions of the product of 11

442
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:40,096
The thing we want is on the right hand side so we'll divide through body of a

443
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:42,144
And we'll get the answer

444
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,216
So this is

445
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:50,336
Fee of R given x x

446
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:52,896
/ theater

447
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:57,504
Until we can compute using the sum rule

448
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,832
Which we just write down over that so I wouldn't run it again

449
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,720
Wow I will actually that's right there

450
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:13,376
I'll go one extra step is we can take each of those terms

451
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,656
Over there

452
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:20,800
See if given s equals 0 x p a vesicle

453
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,848
To write each of them at

454
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,384
Explicitly

455
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:30,528
Okay

456
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:37,952
So that the rules of probability tell you how to do inference that tells you how to do decoding and we can take

457
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:43,072
An example of vector se01 1

458
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:45,376
And we can apply these rules

459
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:55,872
So this is how it's not only that this is a sensible Dakota but it'll tell us how probable each of its answers is

460
00:34:56,128 --> 00:35:01,760
To be correct so for example if you received 01 Wong

461
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,112
And the two things we need to know ever had we need to know

462
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:09,696
This thing was just killed the likelihood

463
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:11,744
All of us

464
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:15,840
And here we thought the prior or the TV

465
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:24,800
So we need to work out what's the probability that

466
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:29,664
Has that value is equal to 0

467
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:34,272
Combination of the Pro Bowl get off if x is equal to 1

468
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:40,672
So what's the probability of getting 01 warm out if the sender was trying to

469
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:43,744
To send a single zero I have to be

470
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:48,096
A non-flat which has a problem

471
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,888
Then how to be a flip

472
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:56,288
Then have another flight so that's the probability of guessing that

473
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,312
Was there a

474
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:00,384
That's the light to go to vesicle Sarah

475
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:07,552
FS1 what's the probability of getting 0-1-1 in the first bit

476
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:13,952
And then both of the last two bit would have to be in each of those

477
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:17,792
Independent probability of being Netflix

478
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,328
Okay

479
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:20,352
So that's

480
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:23,168
1 - 1/2 x squared

481
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:27,264
And this is after the 1 * 1 - F

482
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:31,616
And this exponent are which in this case is Wong

483
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,664
Is

484
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,248
The number of bits that would have to be

485
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,064
Flips for this hypothesis to be right

486
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,856
Number of bits

487
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:44,416
Fat wood

488
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:46,464
Have

489
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,512
Pain

490
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,656
Well then

491
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:57,984
A list to which is no longer missing

492
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,544
Is the number of agreements

493
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,920
Between

494
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:13,088
What the transmission Vector would be for that ass on the C factor that we're actually dealing with

495
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:21,024
Okay and the more agreement you have the bigger the likely it is because Walmart his ass is bigger than

496
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,608
Okay suck

497
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,936
That's not derive this Dakota

498
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:37,664
Let's make an additional assumption we can only answer this question if we say what the probability of s is then we can

499
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,944
Get an answer

500
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,248
The posterior probability

501
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:47,648
Am I going to say the following I'm going to say if the probability of 0 is

502
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:54,048
Obviously the wrong then

503
00:37:55,328 --> 00:38:01,472
We can actually write down the inference the probability that his long given our a011

504
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:05,056
Is 1 - 1/3 squared

505
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:07,360
X f x 1/2

506
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,896
/

507
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:15,296
The same time as grass downstairs like this Plus

508
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:18,368
The other time

509
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:20,672
The other explanation

510
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:29,888
American simplified

511
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:36,288
How many Council everything out you got

512
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,824
One- at

513
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:44,224
So we've now answered in that table we just had going to ask hot we've looked at 1

514
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:51,648
The road is there a long and not what we what is the probability that SS

515
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:55,744
Equal to one given or is there one one

516
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,328
Is 1 - 1/2 which is 90%

517
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,400
So it was a sensible thing to say you should guess

518
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,168
I want

519
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:07,776
Write a note you can repeat that for all eight possible answers

520
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:14,688
Almost all of them just the same but if you received

521
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:15,712
Slightly different

522
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:19,040
Answer for the probability of

523
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:21,344
What the Dakota says you should guess

524
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,392
Suck

525
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:32,608
Just to finish this off I'm laboring it because it's good to be clear on the simple case then we can go and

526
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:36,192
Do more complicated ones

527
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:41,312
The probability that it was a warm is bigger than the probability that

528
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:43,616
It was a zero

529
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:47,968
Islam is the best guess

530
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:49,760
Okay

531
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:54,112
Has the best gas because it did involve the smallest number of flips

532
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:03,840
So I'll leave as an exercise doing the case is warmer one so you can work out

533
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:04,864
Their probability

534
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,656
In that case

535
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:10,752
Suck now we have a new task

536
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:14,336
This was using probabilities to do inference

537
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:18,944
Now what I want to work out is how well does this Dakota perform

538
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:34,048
So this is an example of

539
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:40,448
I want to ask the question if we use a repetition code

540
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:46,080
Frank Otis

541
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:50,688
What's 70 / binary symmetric Channel with a flip probability ass

542
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:55,296
And then we use the majority vote Dakota to give us

543
00:40:56,832 --> 00:41:00,672
What is the probability that

544
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:02,976
Will not equal

545
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:08,864
That's what I'm talking here about a single bit so we send one bit over the channel using this procedure

546
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,680
What's the probability that the S 1/2 we end up

547
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:17,568
Spitting out about Dakota will not be the same as the bit that went to TNA

548
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,440
Okay

549
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:35,232
Announcers

550
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,280
The flip probability IS F

551
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:39,840
What's the probability

552
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:42,144
Have an error of this system

553
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:45,984
Animal

554
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:50,848
What probability distribution are you thinking about anyone

555
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:59,551
Savannah distribution imagine that

556
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:04,159
What outcomes would cause this thing to happen

557
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:06,719
Outcomes you need to look up in the daytime book

558
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:17,727
Two or more Flats in a block the probability of 3 Flats in a block

559
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:20,543
Is f cubed

560
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:25,663
That's pretty unlikely for them old beef lips

561
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:32,063
The other thing that could happen and these are exclusive possibilities is that exactly

562
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,855
32 flips

563
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:37,183
I'm more likely things that we should refocus attention on this time

564
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:38,207
How

565
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:41,791
Probable is it that two flips will occur in a block

566
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:46,399
S3f Squad 1 - x

567
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:50,495
Which you can read out of your day to book on the binomial distribution

568
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:56,127
Thank the three ways of a happening that's why the three

569
00:42:56,383 --> 00:43:02,527
Comes from the three ways of choosing which bits off limit when you're flipping 2 from 3

570
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:09,183
That's roughly 3x squared plus some other stuff

571
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,975
Remind us to fq

572
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:12,767
This is the dominant

573
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,559
Tamil eating Behavior

574
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:22,239
Alright so what we done so far we started out

575
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:25,567
With no code

576
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:33,503
Andre had a probability of bit error

577
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:40,415
Which was

578
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:44,511
For example 0.1

579
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:50,655
And when we didn't use a code at all

580
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:57,055
Alcoa communication at rate one because every time you use the channel you are attempting to send one bit

581
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:03,455
Then we invented the repetition code which is got a rate of 1/3

582
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:05,503
Set all three

583
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:08,831
How the rate of Wallingford

584
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:13,183
You send one bit for every three uses of the channel

585
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:18,815
And it's our probability is roughly 3x squared

586
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:21,887
That is some good news

587
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:25,983
Assuming the Earth is a small number like 0.1

588
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:28,287
The repetition code is making things better

589
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,847
But the bad news is the rate has gone down

590
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:32,895
Sucks

591
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:41,087
Remember what we want to do is want the system solution that gives us an error probability of a

592
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:45,439
About 10 to the minus 15 will maybe even ten to the minus 18

593
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:49,023
We could continue with repetition coats

594
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:55,935
And a hug what problem is to look at

595
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:57,727
How many repetitions do you need

596
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:00,799
In order to achieve

597
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:05,663
10 - 15

598
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:13,855
Assuming that we using a repetition code

599
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:22,303
How cold is probability of bitter ipb for short

600
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:26,143
So that's how my problem

601
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:30,751
And I'll tell you the answer for free it's about 61

602
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:34,335
We wanted a system solution

603
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:36,639
And here is one solution

604
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:43,295
Let's say that this is a single disk drive what we do is repackage up 61 of them all inside

605
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:44,575
The Box

606
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:50,975
That's why it's great big stack I would put a single wrap around it

607
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:57,375
This is one gigabyte disk drive

608
00:45:57,631 --> 00:46:01,727
You copy the file

609
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:05,311
On to all of this right and use the majority vote

610
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,591
And outcomes

611
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:08,127
Answer

612
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:14,015
I'm at majority vote will be right with the probability of ten to the minus 15 but each bit

613
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:16,575
So you may have one happy customer

614
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:23,743
But you probably wouldn't have a thousand happy customers and you've got a very big stack of this drives hidden inside this

615
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:24,767
Fox

616
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:29,631
Okay so that's one option we can repeat lots of times

617
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:32,447
And we can get the error probability down

618
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:38,847
Initial customer say no 10-15 is not good enough and he just like

619
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:45,247
Cost more Destroyers I put even though this rise in the box and you can still achieve any Target but the cost

620
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:46,783
Go steadily up

621
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:48,319
Okay

622
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:50,367
Let's not get to the exciting bit

623
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:54,463
Where can we get to on this diagram

624
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,583
I got to tell you

625
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,399
Another way of making coats

626
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:08,799
Which is to use parity bits which cost adjusted at the beginning I'm going to tell you about the seven Full House

627
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:10,335
Encode

628
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:19,039
And then I'm going to tell you Shannon's result but where we can get to on this diagram

629
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:23,647
Codeworks

630
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:32,607
It's cool to 74 Hammond code because it takes four Source bits of the time and then close them into set

631
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:34,143
7 transmitted bits

632
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:44,127
So we can have three extra party bits and it works like this we write S1 S2

633
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:45,919
3 + 4

634
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:48,223
Into the circle tattoo

635
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:50,015
And then we set

636
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:51,295
The remaining

637
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:53,599
3 bit switch local t v

638
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:54,623
P6

639
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:59,487
27 steps of a parity in each circle even

640
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:02,815
So let's do an example

641
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:08,447
I'm going to encode for u1000

642
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:15,359
Set wish send as in the clear 1000 and then we're going to send three more bit afterwards

643
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:21,759
And those fits I determined by writing 1000 in order

644
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:23,295
And then

645
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:26,623
We find the parity in this circle

646
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:32,511
Wang so that the total party is even with a zero k

647
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:37,631
What's the one that we read the matching the right Toyota 01

648
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:40,703
That thing

649
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:45,311
Let's do one more example

650
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:51,455
1110

651
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:52,991
Taiwan

652
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:55,295
110

653
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:57,087
Party in here

654
00:48:57,343 --> 00:49:01,183
Three so far which is also put another one and even

655
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:05,791
This is even already so we write 070

656
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:09,375
So that link codes 21110

657
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:12,447
Halo by 100

658
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:15,263
Okay

659
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:17,055
No

660
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:20,895
That's the encoder

661
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:22,943
We need a decoder for myself

662
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:27,295
And

663
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:33,695
Just as for the repetition code the decoder is going to be the Dakota that spits out

664
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:35,487
I guess s

665
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:36,767
The difference

666
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:43,935
Who's transmission sorry to ask who's transmission TFS difference from what we were

667
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:45,215
Received in dispute

668
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:47,007
Flips as possible

669
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:01,855
Black cat

670
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:06,207
So the general idea is

671
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:12,863
PMS giving off his P of all given ass

672
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:19,263
Likelihood David s's baby have the

673
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:25,663
The fewest flips that comes up with the hypothesis that involve the smallest

674
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:28,735
Number of flips I will do that

675
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:33,343
By writing what we receive in to the same diagram that we

676
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:34,623
Created over that

677
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:38,719
So we got to write the man in the same order are Wong

678
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:41,791
Aa203

679
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:45,631
And I'll fool and all 5 up there

680
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:46,911
06

681
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:48,447
7

682
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:52,287
Not because the noises come along and could have flipped anything

683
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:53,567
This all could be

684
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:59,967
Anavex virtual and it may not satisfy these rules that we had I would have the rule being that the pirate

685
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,271
Cnh Circle should be even

686
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:04,575
And what we're going to do is identify

687
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:08,671
Which of those rules are satisfied in which I'm not satisfied

688
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:10,719
And then we'll use that

689
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:12,511
Pill identify

690
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:15,327
Which bits we think they've been flat

691
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:18,655
So anything could happen

692
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:23,519
Let's imagine that we send this signal this transmission

693
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:26,847
Let's imagine

694
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:28,383
Along the way

695
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:30,431
02

696
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,711
Is received

697
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:32,991
Flips

698
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:36,831
Okay

699
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:38,879
So what we receive

700
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:46,047
110-0101

701
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:52,703
We don't know what happened that so little secret that we will remind us

702
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:54,751
But we don't know that

703
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:56,543
So now we right

704
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:58,335
That into

705
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:00,383
Histogram

706
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:02,687
So we write in

707
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:06,783
Warm

708
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,319
Wang

709
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:10,111
0

710
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:11,391
0

711
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:13,695
Sera

712
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:14,719
Warm

713
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:17,279
Announce we

714
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:21,631
Color the circles in accordance with whether that happy or not

715
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:28,287
This is unhappy that will color that red circle

716
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:35,711
Listicle

717
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:38,783
It's happy

718
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:44,671
Not positive happiness and sadness will cava syndrome of the received

719
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:45,695
Signal

720
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:56,191
And now I'm going to tell you what rule for coming up with a hypothesis of what happened there are many hypothesis

721
00:52:56,447 --> 00:53:00,543
Could account for the syndrome because there's all sorts of flips that could have happened

722
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:05,407
The rule is going to be

723
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:09,503
Find

724
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:14,879
The bit this is inside Olson circles and outside Oliver happy circles

725
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:18,719
And then identify that one has the bit that must have been flipped

726
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:20,767
Not sure but that's going to Be Our Guest

727
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:26,399
So inside all the sad circles outside the green circles is this guy

728
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:28,959
So we identify this guy

729
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:30,751
As I guess

730
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:35,615
We guessed this was flipped

731
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:38,943
And so then we spit out

732
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:45,087
I'll guess fatigue is 100010 long and I guess for s

733
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:47,647
Is the first four bits of that

734
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:49,695
Which is 1000

735
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:50,975
Which is the right answer

736
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:54,303
In this case we have succeeded

737
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:06,079
Now

738
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:12,223
If actually what happened with the noise of come along and split two bits

739
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:18,111
Then this decoding rule is going to go and find a single bit that it can run flat

740
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:19,135
Two account

741
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:20,159
So what happened

742
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:24,767
Pokemon that with three bits being messed up so this Dakota is not infallible

743
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:28,095
It is the case

744
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:29,375
That this

745
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:30,911
Encoder and decoder

746
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:34,239
Can detect and correct any single flip

747
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:37,823
So any single flip

748
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,871
Canby

749
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:46,015
Check it on credit

750
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:50,623
So that's nice but

751
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:57,535
More than one because

752
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:59,071
Then

753
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:02,143
It turns out and you can prove this is a hard work

754
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:03,167
Problem

755
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:05,727
Then your guest pass

756
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:12,895
Will not be the original s

757
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:13,919
Vidalia vet

758
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:19,295
It's only want to sleep in a block and sixties just like all three the repetition code

759
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:24,415
But if it's to flexo more than more in trouble and this diagram

760
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:29,535
On the screen shows the performance of The Seven full how many code

761
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:31,839
100 problem is to workout

762
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:35,167
What is probability of error is

763
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:37,215
What's the probability of a flip

764
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:42,591
Of an error occurring

765
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:45,663
When we use this and codrin Dakota

766
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:52,063
And what you'll find out when you do that moment problem is the probability of a blood Cara

767
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:58,975
Is roughly 21 f-squared you'll find that out using the binomial distribution

768
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:02,559
Find the probability of

769
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:05,631
Is about 9 ft squared

770
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:07,679
Deleting order

771
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:12,031
Okay

772
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:14,591
So Shannon asked the question

773
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:17,663
If we make encoders and decoders

774
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:19,967
Where can we get to on this diagram

775
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:28,415
Got a few ideas repetition codes on I-71 code using parities

776
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:43,519
The question is what's the boundary between achievable and unachievable points

777
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,567
On this diagram

778
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:48,383
And before Shannon

779
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:54,783
Conceived of asking that question I think conventional wisdom was at the boundary between achievable

780
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:56,575
A knowledgeable points

781
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:59,135
Just have to be

782
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:02,463
Some sort of line going through the origin

783
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:09,375
Because songs lost as if you were really small then surely you're going to have a really small right

784
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:10,911
Just like our gnomus stack

785
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:12,959
I've described that we are imagining

786
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:19,103
So conventional wisdom knew that points over here where it's evil

787
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:24,223
But conventional wisdom probably was assuming that the boundary

788
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:26,783
Went somewhere

789
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:35,487
Soundproof an absolutely remarkable results and this is going to be

790
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:38,303
Of the secret door latches to prove

791
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:39,327
Bits result

792
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:44,447
China proof that you can get the error probability small

793
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:46,751
Without the rate having to go to zero

794
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:48,287
Search an improved

795
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:51,871
Set the boundary between achievable and knowledgeable pints

796
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:54,431
Is a line that looks like this

797
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:58,783
Everyone here is achievable

798
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:01,855
And excitingly

799
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:03,135
This line

800
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:04,927
Meet the re taxes

801
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:06,975
I don't know right

802
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:14,143
Handicap that's an exciting place to talk about we give it a name and we'll call it see the capacity of the

803
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:16,191
The channel that were disgusting

804
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:18,495
For example

805
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:22,335
The capacity of the binary symmetric Channel

806
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:24,383
Where the flip probability ass

807
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:25,919
Is

808
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:32,319
One- the binary entropy function of F

809
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:33,599
Function

810
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:34,367
For you

811
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:35,647
Right now

812
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:37,183
It is

813
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:42,047
So there is the line between achievable and not achievable points

814
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:43,583
So what does this mean

815
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:50,239
Shannon sports are selling a test drive at this drive is the one gigabyte destroyed mate

816
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:52,543
61 drives Inside the Box

817
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:53,567
Annie sez

818
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:55,871
You don't need 61 Drive In The Box

819
00:58:56,127 --> 00:59:00,223
Together and our probability of 10-15 you just need to disk drives

820
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:01,759
Because

821
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:05,087
For the case where f is 0.1

822
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:07,647
The capacity when you work out this formula

823
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:09,951
Comes out to 0.53

824
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:14,047
Which is bigger than a hop in the Box

825
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:20,703
And then there exists an anchoring system in the decoding system that can correct as many hours as

826
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:27,103
As you like whatever ever prove it to you name that exists an encoding and decoding system

827
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:28,639
That are probability

828
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:31,199
Pennsylvania's 15th no problem to describes

829
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:32,735
10 - 18

830
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:33,503
To destroy

831
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:35,295
10 - 60

832
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:36,063
To Des Moines

833
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:37,855
That is Shannon's

834
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:39,647
Noisy Channel coding theorem

835
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:42,975
So for any channels

836
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:47,327
Encoders and decoders that can achieve reliable communication

837
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:51,679
At any rate up to this country called the capacity of

838
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:52,447
Channel

839
00:59:55,263 --> 01:00:00,127
I'm going to wrap up now I've just got three things to say first election oats

840
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:01,151
4

841
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:07,551
This lecture chapter 1 in this book which is a free online book also available from all your favorite book

842
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:13,951
Bookshops you can get it from Amazon you can get it from Cambridge University press and it's free on the website

843
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:15,743
Hibiscus as a PDF

844
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:18,303
Like two notes on chapter one

845
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:21,887
For the next lecture I recommend that you read chapter 2

846
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:29,311
And the remaining lectures of its core organic of information Theory will continue discussing the

847
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:35,711
Noisy Channel coding theorem

848
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:38,783
How to make files smaller

849
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:42,111
Then we'll move on to discussing data modeling and recognition

850
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:48,511
Learning and memory I will talk about various inference methods approximate inference methods

851
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:49,535
Neural networks

852
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:55,679
The final thing I want to say is please before the next lecture have a think about this puzzle

853
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:57,215
Physical the waiting

854
01:00:57,471 --> 01:00:59,007
Problem the weighing puzzle

855
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:00,543
When it goes like this

856
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:02,335
The given 12 Bulls

857
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:04,895
All of which are equal in weight

858
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:11,295
Except for one and you're told that exactly one of them has got a different way and it's either heavier or lighter

859
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:17,951
Girls are giving a balance and the balance is one way you can put any number of bulls on one side and the same number on the other

860
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:23,327
And then initiate the weighing and it even comes I like this or this balance

861
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:26,655
And the task is to identify the old bull

862
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:32,287
And whether it's heavier or lighter in a few uses of the balance as possible

863
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:35,615
So that's going to be the first thing that we discuss

864
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:37,151
In the next lecture

865
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:39,455
Thank you very much for coming thanks for listening

1
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:05,376
Welcome again

2
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:09,472
Today I'll recap what we've done in bass compression

3
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:10,752
And then we'll

4
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:12,544
Get back to

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,152
The central topic if you like if the information Theory course which is noisy Channel

6
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:19,456
Coding the tree looked at him

7
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:24,064
Let me start with a little

8
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:27,392
Question I set for you last time

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,048
The question is about this Ensemble ABCD with 458

10
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:36,096
And with the symbol code

11
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,632
Showing that

12
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:39,168
And the question is

13
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:45,568
If we are and Cody from this source and then we reach into the encoded string to put out one bit what's the problem

14
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:49,152
But it's a one please talk to your neighbor

15
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:51,200
How about your answer

16
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,480
To this question

17
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:58,368
Okay

18
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:05,792
What type of votes there are three options that you worked out P1 I hope you've talked to you in a

19
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,840
And

20
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,376
I'm going to ask you

21
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:11,680
Is your pee one lesson haha

22
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:12,960
Whole pig on a half

23
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:15,776
And you can also vote for the dead which is I don't know

24
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,824
Places that I don't know

25
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:21,664
Hey votes for a few on his less than 1/2

26
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:22,944
Okay

27
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,736
A few guys that

28
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,272
4

29
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:31,392
Votes of BP 1 is equal to

30
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:33,696
1

31
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,328
One vote for me but it's the cp1 is big enough

32
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,888
Everyone else except

33
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:42,912
The people who've

34
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,192
Okay we don't want that

35
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:49,568
No one voted for that so everyone else must be asleep already

36
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:56,224
Okay what we've got a range of advances that people from community

37
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,040
T a p 1 less than 1/2

38
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:05,952
Could a volunteer take us through the GOP one

39
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,232
What was your method for

40
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,256
Stop touching people

41
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,840
Since we're the majority

42
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,168
Okay who voted Ray

43
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:20,032
Alright what was what was Obi-Wan

44
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,616
What was the value

45
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:24,896
Anyone

46
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:28,992
Unknown

47
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,392
Well can I help at

48
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:39,488
Let's talk about

49
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,048
The fraction

50
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,096
Of

51
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,656
The code word that is made

52
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,680
Bald

53
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:51,776
Wong's and see what happens if we look at that

54
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,080
Coded a

55
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:57,408
The code for a which happens all the time

56
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,248
Has golf

57
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,528
0

58
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:09,696
Who won the next Kobe's Hawthorne security is 2/3 ones

59
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:12,000
Andy is 100%

60
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:17,888
Wangsa defined as the fraction of the code which is ones

61
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:23,776
So a lot of people are voting for a but you're being very shy about saying why

62
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:28,640
And I'm going to give a possible arguments that might give an answer this in the icon

63
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:29,664
Stop

64
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:35,296
With Pekka CO2 at first but then we pick a random bit to see if it's

65
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:39,648
I want or zero in these are the probabilities that being the one or zero

66
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:43,488
So here's a calculation probability of getting a warm

67
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,280
I'll put a? I like this

68
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:51,936
I want to check if I've got your reasoning right probability of getting a sum of

69
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:54,240
Letters in the alphabet

70
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:57,312
Probability of picking up letter

71
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,384
X the probability of it

72
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,248
Turning out to be a woman when you pick a random bit from the code word

73
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,016
Yeah

74
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:12,416
Is that the sort of reasoning that the I can meet you until your life to know that stalking is stiff

75
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,512
Have a good 1/2 * 0

76
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:20,863
Plus 1/4 times

77
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,143
Plus

78
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:25,471
1/8 * 2/3

79
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:29,055
8 * 1

80
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,639
Alright which gives us

81
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,919
Banh mi

82
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,967
Plus

83
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:36,991
All right

84
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,527
Plus

85
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:41,087
Tonight I'm 2/3

86
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,903
Which is

87
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,559
1/8 times 2 2/3

88
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,863
2 + 2/3 is

89
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,399
8 / 3

90
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:58,495
Which is giving us too long first

91
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:00,543
Okay

92
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:06,687
Does anyone who voted for a think that this is roughly why they voted for a thumbs up

93
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:12,063
Okay

94
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:15,903
But not everyone agreed we've got some bees and seeds does anyone want to

95
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:20,255
Challenge this since I know it's wrong has an argument why that's wrong

96
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,607
Anyone

97
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,703
The a side

98
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,799
Yeah

99
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:42,527
Okay. My son just said if you reach into the stream and some of the code was a

100
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,063
Long or short

101
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:48,671
When you reach in and pick a random bit you're more likely to hit one of the long code works

102
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:55,583
Alright so this isn't the correct way to pick a random bit from the stream we need to take into account the

103
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,863
Lengths

104
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:00,959
So that's a good argument okay so this is probably wrong

105
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:04,287
At least it's the wrong message it may not be the wrong answer

106
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,383
Set length

107
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,687
Length of

108
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,479
Code words

109
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,575
Any other argument

110
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,111
I know that answer

111
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:27,583
Okay let me give you one of the arguments of this and then we'll do the calculation again

112
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:33,727
What's the information content of this probability

113
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:34,751
Hair

114
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:39,871
I'm sorry one bit free bits and freeways

115
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:43,967
What's the ideal encoded lengths for probabilities

116
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:48,831
We are dealing Cody links the Shannon information content switch

117
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:52,159
From now on I will just call them the information contacts

118
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:58,815
What are the links of these lengths is one two three

119
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,887
The links masked information contents

120
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,447
So this is a case where

121
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,983
We have a symbol code

122
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,287
With perfectly matched

123
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,311
Curtain lengths

124
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,335
2

125
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,615
The probabilities

126
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,199
That means you can't compress any better than this

127
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:22,367
Because we have our souls cutting their lips as you can compress time to expect if the lights of your car

128
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:24,927
Information content

129
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,767
Hi this is a valid code is a prefix code

130
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,303
This this will work

131
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,607
No

132
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:36,191
If we use this code and code stuff from the source

133
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:41,311
And if it were the case that the bits coming out after encoding

134
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:46,431
We're not 50/50 zeros in 1 completely random independent unlicensed which are

135
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,503
If if I would not 50/50

136
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,783
Then

137
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,319
We could compress it some more

138
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:55,903
Because Simon says if the probabilities are 50/50

139
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,439
We can make coach and I would

140
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:01,535
Stopping bags for the lottery tickets and we could do for the compression

141
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:05,375
But you can't compress anymore cuz we've already got it down.

142
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:09,727
Vessel without doing any calculation of total it must be the case

143
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,007
51 is 1/2

144
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,799
Savvy is the right answer

145
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:17,919
Because it's perfectly compressed and uncompressed it will look random

146
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,735
Okay so the right answer

147
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:23,551
Is B so what went wrong with this calculation

148
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,855
Well that's a free do it and

149
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:29,439
Do the calculation in a way that takes into length

150
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:34,303
Let's think about it this way we really great big bucket we're going to

151
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,095
Put

152
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,143
Bits into the bucket

153
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:41,215
Each time you pick a code with some more

154
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:47,871
It's got in the bucket and some of those are ones we're interested in the ratio in this bucket what fractional

155
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,151
Wong's

156
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:59,391
Let's give ourselves an extra column in hair which is not the fraction that's all ones but have phone number

157
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,207
For the number

158
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:06,559
Of warm denisco dresses 02

159
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,839
10 - 1 is 3

160
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:13,215
So on average when I

161
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,007
Pick another code word

162
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:20,895
How many new bits go into the code but will put that downstairs

163
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,735
Mansur is samurai

164
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,759
PTI

165
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,295
Ally

166
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:31,903
And on average how many ones go into the bucket

167
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,463
Last summer i t i

168
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:36,767
Ann.

169
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,071
Okay

170
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,655
How does that differ from what we did over here

171
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:46,239
Well f i is the ratio of and I

172
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,263
Nova

173
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,591
Ally so you can see

174
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:54,943
Will using a different thing upstairs and to compensate for that while using something

175
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,967
Different dances

176
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:02,623
Okay so this is the average number of ones that go in the bucket whenever you pick a new code with this is the average number of

177
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,695
The gummy the ratio of those is going to be the fraction

178
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:08,511
Offbits that I want spliff we do that

179
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,047
We have

180
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,583
The

181
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,887
Upstairs thing is

182
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,727
Hahaha * 0

183
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:24,639
Across X

184
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,919
Wong

185
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,223
+ 1/8

186
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:34,879
X 2 X 3 I'm downstairs it's our old friend.

187
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,647
Banks

188
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,183
Which is the entry fee

189
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,231
Of this probability distribution

190
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,511
Which is

191
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,839
7 / 4

192
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,935
I'm doing this memory

193
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,519
And what's upstairs

194
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,127
That's a quarter

195
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,455
Free

196
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,087
So in Eighth Street.

197
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:08,159
2 + 2 + 3 which is 7 / 8

198
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,719
I wish I might

199
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,023
Wichita

200
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:19,423
So that's a long way to get the answer for the sneaky information Theory based on certain is just to say especially

201
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,191
Breast

202
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:23,007
Case Closed its 50/50

203
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:29,151
It's not any 50/50 it's got no correlations and is it electric can be no correlations

204
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,687
Indian Kodi

205
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:37,087
Stream it's otherwise we could use the information Theory arguments and say all those correlations could be

206
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,623
Splash hit those dependencies

207
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,439
Any questions

208
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:48,863
So we love information. Provide you with very powerful they brief arguments the things that means

209
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,911
You don't need to do calculations anymore

210
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:57,567
Last time let me just recap what we did we introduced symbol codes

211
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,663
Or rather the time before last. She symbol codes

212
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,455
And

213
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:11,391
Symbol codes are widely used we have a Huffman algorithm that gives you upload symbol codes and that expected length Within

214
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,439
1 bit per character

215
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,719
Off the entropy

216
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:18,559
But we argued in the previous lecture

217
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,607
We could go that

218
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:27,007
Doesn't actually wrap up compression we don't like symbol code because being within one bit of a character is not very good

219
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:33,407
Enter people character is something small like 0.1 bits and we argued that often that will be the

220
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:36,479
Kasich say with compressing English

221
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:43,391
We play the game that gave us the idea that you could use identical twins at the sender and the receiver in order to make a

222
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,159
Compressor

223
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,719
And then we looked at at MIT coding

224
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:53,119
Decoding is this way of thinking about her binary file as defining a single

225
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,703
Real number between 0 and Wong to an extremely large precision

226
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,727
And any

227
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:01,311
Source file can be represented in the same way as in

228
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:05,151
Responding to an interval on the real line between 0 and 1

229
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,479
And

230
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:12,319
I argued that when you do ask me coding

231
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:18,975
You will get compression down to within two bits all the information content of the entire file so this is

232
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,535
In terms of its overhead this + 2

233
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:25,631
Is potentially about a plant from M smaller than the overhead you got

234
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:30,239
If you use symbol code so coating is in almost all cases

235
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,799
Far far better than symbol codes

236
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,639
And

237
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:43,807
I just wanted to flush out how you'd use out of plastic coating in practice I told by the idea of an oracle

238
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:50,207
Hold that being a piece of software which uses some procedures to predict the next Carta given all the time

239
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:53,279
Does x 1/2 x 2 - 1 that have been seen

240
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,559
I don't want to just

241
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:59,167
Give you an example of how this works in Rio state-of-the-art compressors

242
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:03,007
So here is a fragment of Jane Austen's Emma

243
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:09,407
This is the last fifty or so characters and the context is along.

244
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:15,807
Pro and the question is what comes next so how do real compression algorithms work well

245
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,575
8

246
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:22,975
Feleena state-of-the-art compressor that's very widely used is a compressor Co PPM and

247
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:25,023
His her PPI mean what

248
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,583
Atsko prediction by partial match

249
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:33,983
And it's slightly I talked but this a bunch of theoretical justifications and improvements we can make sure

250
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,287
Let me describe the I talk my head

251
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,591
We look at the context

252
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:41,919
That's the last five characters of the document

253
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:44,735
Define the context for the next character

254
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:50,879
Then we look at the entire file of everything that we've seen so far and we say

255
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:54,719
Have we seen that contacts before in the entire file

256
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:58,815
So this is how we're going to then predict what happens next to go and find

257
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:01,631
All of those occurrences in here they all showed in blue

258
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:05,727
Sorry space pro has happened 1 2 3 4

259
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:08,799
Five times already in Jane Austen's Emma

260
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:13,151
And this shows what happened next Was A V A V and o a p and the nest

261
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,431
So

262
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:20,831
A first stop would be to say let's use these six grams to tistics the rules 6 crime statistics

263
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:27,231
260-211-2345

264
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,535
56 chance of getting a v next

265
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,095
There's a 1/5 chance of

266
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:38,495
I want V transfer p and 1/5 chance

267
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:41,823
You better allow some other things happening

268
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:48,479
How to allow for other things happening well the PPM approaches to say let's back off to

269
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:54,879
Shoulder-length contacts as well and say what happened in contacts space Pro

270
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:58,975
Roo and in any context tutorial

271
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:01,791
Unfolding those other

272
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:07,167
1 2 3 4 5 possibilities in addition to the six crime statistics

273
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,983
And wait them together in a small fish weigh

274
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,311
And that's a PPM works

275
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:18,943
And it gives you extremely good compression state-of-the-art

276
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:25,855
On most files it doesn't do as well as humans do human audiences like yourself can predict English

277
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:32,255
A lot better until it doesn't understand grammar and diction recent insightful but it does a lot of learning

278
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,791
Avril statistics and that's

279
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,607
I got you a long way towards

280
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,631
Good compression

281
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,679
So that's PPM

282
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:55,807
Okay so the question was does it learn the 6 crime statistics of the document of the entire document

283
00:16:56,063 --> 00:17:02,207
Compressor what does it do it on the Fly and the important answer is it's just like you guys it

284
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:04,255
Identical twin audiences

285
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:10,655
It does things on the fly so when were asked to predict in this contact Revenge site how often has

286
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:15,519
Has East Bass Pro happened already before now we don't look ahead into the future

287
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:18,847
So the predictions are based only on what we have already seen

288
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,127
Okay

289
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,407
Any other questions

290
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:29,855
Does a couple more things I want to mention about coding one is as I showed you last time we can

291
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:35,231
Make other uses of arithmetic coding we can make an extremely efficient ranking system

292
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:40,351
The one I showed you was kielbasa that's based on the idea that

293
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:45,983
Writing involves making gestures of some sort maybe wiggling fingers or scribbling with a stick

294
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:50,335
And you want to turn those gestures into text as efficiently as possible

295
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:56,735
And compression is all about taking text and turning it into a bit string which in North Dakota is used

296
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:57,759
Does a real member

297
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:04,159
And so we can make a very good writing system by saying okay let's have the gesture just defining a real number by staring

298
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:04,927
Spaceship

299
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:11,327
In a two-dimensional world and that will make us if we turned on its head a very efficient writing system so you make

300
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,655
So that's the best concept

301
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:20,031
And I showed you that and it's free software and help is always welcome to make

302
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,311
Basa Basa

303
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:25,919
Another application for arithmetic coding I wanted to mention

304
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:29,503
And this is the idea of efficiently generating

305
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,039
Random samples

306
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:35,647
Let me give you an example let's say I asked you to simulate

307
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,671
A bent

308
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,719
Coin and I said okay

309
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:41,023
Let's fix PA

310
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,631
0.01

311
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:48,959
Honey PB is the rest

312
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,263
Please simulate

313
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:54,335
10 million tosses of this bent coin

314
00:18:54,591 --> 00:19:00,735
And I will provide you with random bits a random number generator the question is how many bits would you need to use

315
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,015
To generate

316
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:04,575
10 million

317
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,367
Tuffy's of this coin

318
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,975
Let's say an from now on instead of 10 million

319
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:17,631
A standard way of solving a problem is to say oh well I'll use the random bits you can provide me with

320
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:18,911
How to make

321
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:25,311
Real numbers between 0 and Wang so I'll generate things that I'll think

322
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,847
Real numbers

323
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,919
Uniformly distributed between 0 and 1

324
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:34,527
That will double up 32 bit

325
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,319
Real number

326
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,111
If it's a standard

327
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:43,231
Random number generator so we're eating first few bits and separate them is defining a number between 0 and 1

328
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:47,071
Then we look to see if you is less than PA

329
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:51,423
And if it is then we split a tonight and otherwise

330
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,751
This method will cost you 32 bits

331
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:55,775
The character

332
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,311
All right

333
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:01,151
Can we do better on Dewey cat

334
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,943
The answer is yes

335
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,223
And maybe

336
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:08,831
So yes we can do much better because we could take a nice medic coda

337
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:13,439
And think about it this way let's wipe the board

338
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:17,279
Imagine sticking a pin

339
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,607
Into the world of an arithmetic Kota

340
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,679
What happens if you stick a pin

341
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:29,055
Uniformly at random into this line that goes from 0 to 2 1

342
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,335
Or into

343
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:39,295
Into one of those lines what comes out

344
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:45,695
Of what comes out if you sticking a pin and use it to select

345
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,231
A string of text

346
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,143
Habitat Geneva

347
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:05,407
Okay well I'm drawn on the bull terriers a couple of different coating wheels that run from zero

348
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,431
Tawam

349
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:14,111
This is one for some Source within alphabet with cartridges ABCD with a few probabilities

350
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,672
And what we noticed last time was

351
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:20,512
They are somatic coding method gives you

352
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:26,912
Intervals between 0 and 1 whose size is the probability of the string equaling that

353
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:29,216
Particular strength probability of X is

354
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:32,032
Is the size of this

355
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,568
Clintonville hair

356
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,640
Herobrine the one for the coin this is

357
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,944
99%

358
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,760
This is 1%

359
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,808
And then we

360
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:45,856
Reticent subdivide this

361
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:51,488
In the same way and we got this is a little bit baby in half

362
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,768
And

363
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:55,072
And his Buffet a b

364
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,608
And

365
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:03,520
All right if we come along and sticking up in the probability that it will land inside this interval here

366
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,312
Is this

367
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:11,712
So the probability that if you've been read out the storm we've got the probability it will begin a c is the

368
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:15,808
Random

369
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:22,208
Is a way of taking a string from the probability distribution of your language model

370
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,744
Okay

371
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:30,144
So what we can do with the coins is make the arithmetic Dakota

372
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,936
Encoder and decoder

373
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:33,216
For the mankind

374
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,776
Then bring along random bits

375
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:37,312
Random Nelson Wong

376
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:40,640
Supposed to Define where pain goes in

377
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:47,296
The pin is sticking up in between 0 and you do that by having an Infinite Source

378
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:49,088
All zeros and ones to Define

379
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,880
Where we are on the line

380
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,160
And

381
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:57,024
So you stop doubling up those zeros and ones find out where the pain is

382
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,816
To the first

383
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,376

Raquel Dakota

386
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,592
How many bits is that going to need well on average

387
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,384
It's just like compression

388
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:16,736
What happened to Binary entropy of newpointe warm is

389
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,784
.1

390
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:25,440
That's on average how many bits you will need certain contrast to needing 32 bits

391
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:31,840
Coin toss

392
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:35,424
The arithmetic coding method

393
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,728
For generating random samples

394
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,008
For the band coin

395
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,544
Is going to need

396
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:45,664
Spider-Man 4 .01 bits

397
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:48,224
Calling

398
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,088
Which is smaller than one quite a lot smaller than once

399
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,624
It's going to be

400
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:59,232
More than a factor 32 times more efficient with your random bits

401
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:02,048
And if random bits are valuable thing

402
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:08,448
You may want to do this so it may strike his elegant but it may actually save you money and I want to close

403
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,472
Close this

404
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:12,544
Discussion

405
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,592
Giving you a little bit of evidence

406
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:20,992
That we do actually care about saving running bits riding bits on all free if you want run a bit you have to get me

407
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:21,760
From somewhere

408
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:22,528
And if

409
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:28,672
What you doing has any so principal purpose you need to verify that good random base

410
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:32,256
And so here's a CD that I received in the post

411
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,792
A few years ago

412
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:40,192
And the CD came with a message saying that this CD contains random bits and they being generated

413
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:43,008
Thanks for the financial support of a couple of

414
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:46,848
US government grants and then distributed

415
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:53,248
Underground from Florida State University to academics around the world who want random bits

416
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:58,112
So Random bits of valuable and this is proof that

417
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:04,512
Serious for such as and Thunders Feud random bits as being important enough to spend US government money on

418
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:08,096
Not wanting to waste

419
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,120
Random bits

420
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,656
Any questions

421
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:14,752
Okay we have not available

422
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,712
Russian make

423
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,992
Numbers I lost

424
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:39,584
Yes so the question is are there other ways of thinking why this is a bad idea to do with the purse

425
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,704
Decision of the numbers you need to make this decision about is it an A or a B

426
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,824
Often you only need the first b**** to already tell you're okay

427
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:56,224
We don't need to look at the next 31 that's the first bit was already made the decision about wasting b**** that

428
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:56,992
Conversely

429
00:25:57,504 --> 00:26:02,368
Actually if you look in detail that other probability that this will spit out

430
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:08,768
I want it's not going to be exactly 1% is it it'll be some ratio roll and

431
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,400
I'm over

432
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:17,472
232 Miami some integer

433
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,264
It's actually going to

434
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,544
Perfectly nice

435
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:26,944
Pay directly with any one person to give you the right

436
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,224
Exactly the right answer

437
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:36,416
So yes it is wasteful because it's using loads of it to make a decision about his

438
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,184
Single bit

439
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:40,256
A&R Medical

440
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,816
Another questions

441
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:51,264
Okay so go to move on to the topic of noisy channels and noisy channels have inputs and output

442
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:56,640
Put some one of the things we want to do with noisy channels his info what the input mahjabeen

443
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:58,432
Given the output of the channel

444
00:26:58,944 --> 00:26:59,456
So

445
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:03,808
A theme of noisy channels is going to be we need to understand inference

446
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,368
I want the clear on how to do inference

447
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:09,696
Will also be talking about how to measure information content

448
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:11,488
In the context of noisy channels

449
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:17,888
So we know how to measure information content for a single random variable like posting a been drawing around them

450
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,680
English it's all about

451
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:21,472
La Guadalupe and that's it

452
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:28,384
Let me know your channel it's all a little bit more interesting because we input speaker outputs were interested in questions like

453
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,736
How much information does seeing this output convey about the input

454
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,528
I want to learn how to do that

455
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,672
Instead of with I just want to give you a little puzzle to think about

456
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:46,304
And it doesn't involve it just involves three cops

457
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:50,400
And here are the three times and I'll introduce you to them one at a time

458
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,960
His account which is

459
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:53,984
White

460
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,544
And white on the front

461
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,592
And the rest

462
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,920
Hezekiah Brown

463
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,968
On the front and reverse

464
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:11,648
And there's a cop it's brown on one side and blank on the other

465
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,608
So I know what I'm going to do is I'll shuffle them and send them over randomly

466
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,888
Unhide them

467
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,960
I draw one card at random

468
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:27,776
Unplugged it down in front of me so I can see it

469
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:34,176
And then I'm going to ask you about the other side of a cop Alright by shuffling randomize

470
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:38,016
I don't think any magic tricks I think has just everything you say is

471
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,552
What's happening

472
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:42,624
So we shut them up and then

473
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,720
I randomly grab a cart on Plunkett down

474
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:47,744
All right

475
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,304
And I show you

476
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:51,584
They

477
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,352
Front

478
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,888
One side of the car

479
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:56,448
It's what the question is

480
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:58,752
What's on the other side

481
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,544
The question is

482
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:07,200
Given that you and I are seeing a white face

483
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:11,296
What the probability of a face card

484
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,064
Is what

485
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,112
Please turn to neighbor and have a chance

486
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,392
Well I question

487
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:21,792
Okay

488
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:24,864
Boats for Zedge which means I don't know

489
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:28,704
Can't got a few dinos

490
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,544
Votes for the probability is less than 1/2

491
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,360
Netflix

492
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,896
It's bigger than 1/2

493
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,688
I fear

494
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:41,248
7 ish

495
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:43,808
I'd like to say it's off it's 50/50

496
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:50,720
1 2 3 4 5 6 crying like except we have some clear uncertainty

497
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,768
I like it when I haven't

498
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:59,424
So let's have an argument from the second Community why is it 50

499
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,192
P50

500
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:02,496
Anyone

501
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,080
Yeah

502
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:24,000
Good so I just said was by Logic it's either this card or that car

503
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,024
And that on the desk

504
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,608
And we don't have any additional information so must be 50/50

505
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:34,752
Like a lot of people who disagree with you so I would one of them like to give an argument wife that

506
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:36,800
Compelling argument of logic

507
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:37,824
Wrong

508
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,592
Yes

509
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:56,000
Okay so what I just said was the three possible ways of getting a white thing facing up here either looking at that side or that side

510
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:59,840
Midol that side in all three of those possibilities are equally likely

511
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:03,680
So either this hypothesis or that one or that one

512
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:04,704
Find

513
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,520
One we will find out

514
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,128
Whether the other side is this all the other side is this or is that

515
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:14,944
So that means it's 2/3

516
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,736
2/3 Champs

517
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,016
It's what

518
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,320
That argument

519
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:21,600
Stertorous

520
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:23,904
Good

521
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,744
Does anyone want to add anything change your mind

522
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,024
Give another argument

523
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,072
Lecrae

524
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:54,880
Okay that's a nice argument so the argument said think about the other side of the card

525
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,928
Which is either going to end up being white or brown

526
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,792
I'm right at the beginning before I bought the car I could have asked you please play some bad

527
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:06,400
Is the concert going to be white O'Brien and we definitely 50/50

528
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,424
Okay

529
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,728
And now the question is

530
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:11,776
We see the front

531
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:14,336
Will not make a change I batter tool

532
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:17,152
Surely it must make a difference

533
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:23,552
And that's a very credible argument that there is a dependence between the front and the back

534
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:29,952
So surely you shouldn't be betting 50/50 anymore doesn't but it does

535
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,256
Not 50/50 because we just let something

536
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:35,072
We know something that we didn't know and there is a dependence

537
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,864
And that's a good argument to

538
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,400
All right

539
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:45,312
So let me give you a suggestion always write down the probability

540
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:47,104
All everything

541
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:59,136
I miss is copyright Steve go

542
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,720
Here is a professor over in me

543
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,000
Building next door

544
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:07,072
Write down the probability of everything

545
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:13,472
All the variables in the problem then you can condition on what has happened and you will be able to deduce by the symbol

546
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:16,544
The answer to your question is

547
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,336
So in this case

548
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:20,128
Everything is

549
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:23,200
The front face

550
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,992
Underverse face

551
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:30,880
And before I did the shuffling through the car.

552
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:34,208
The probability of the front face being

553
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:39,840
White or black and their birthdays being white or black

554
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:44,192
The probability of this pair of variables

555
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,008
Being white and white with long fast

556
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,544
The probability of it being

557
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,592
Brown & Brown

558
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,128
The probability of P

559
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:55,712
Other two things are fed cuz she had that by

560
00:33:55,968 --> 00:34:00,064
Call the black white cop coming along

561
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,344
50/50

562
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,952
Which one yoga

563
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:09,536
That is the joint probability of everything

564
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:13,376
An owl with a strong probability we can

565
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:16,192
Condition

566
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,800
On data and anything else you want to throw in

567
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:27,200
And data is what we're given and what was given is there in this world

568
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:29,504
So today the white face came up

569
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:33,088
Sorry condition on front being white

570
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:40,512
And we can then work out the probability that the

571
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,840
Is

572
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:48,192
White example by Renown 5 English probability distribution

573
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:59,712
This may not convince people who still really think it's 50 50 50 50 how can you say it

574
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:02,784
That's rubbish until I've got one final argument

575
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,832
That I hope will help

576
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:08,928
And then once the document has been accepted

577
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:13,280
Maybe it will compel you to agree that it's a good idea to write down the probability of everything

578
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:21,472
So here's the final argument and it's not that they reverse was indeed white happened to be true but it didn't have to be

579
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:26,848
Imagine we play this game lots of times and instead of asking

580
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:33,248
What's the probability the other face is why I always ask you to question what's the probability that the other faces

581
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,784
The same as the one you'll see now

582
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,832
Okay so

583
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:44,256
This long of us think this was another thing is when they not the same so two-thirds of the time

584
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:46,816
The face will be the same on the back cuz it is on the front

585
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:53,728
So when you say white and when you say Brian does it

586
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,264
Okay

587
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,288
So that's

588
00:35:56,544 --> 00:36:01,920
Not based on probability Theory and I think it's a fairly compelling argument

589
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:03,712
Hopefully that's convinced you

590
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:10,112
That we should use probability Theory because if you cannot sleep reliably solve this exercising

591
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,136
Involving just

592
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:17,536
One random variable which is which card and another on the Bible which is which way up Event Source of to run

593
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:21,888
A problem of graduates from Cambridge

594
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:28,288
Can reliably solve this problem

595
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,336
That really shows you

596
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:32,384
Yeah entrance is a little bit tricky

597
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:38,016
Inference isn't turkey straightforward humans are often very good at inference but if you want to be sure you're getting it right

598
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:42,112
Beautiful very very beautiful real history will always get you the right answer

599
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,648
Okay

600
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:51,584
Alright so let's not talk some more about Noida channels

601
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:59,520
And let me just remind myself what comes up through this

602
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:03,104
Weber heading is a bit more about inference

603
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:07,200
And we're all thinking took that information measures phonology Channel

604
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:11,296
A classic noisy channel is the binary symmetric Channel up that top right

605
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:14,368
Which is obscured by

606
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,160
Water cycle

607
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:29,984
Okay the binders metric Channel with input 0 and 1 and it flips a fraction as of the bits

608
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,592
We want to understand coding theory for any noisy Channel

609
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:42,528
And whenever dealing with noisy tenants we need to know how to do in France that I used to introduce people to inference for the different puzzle

610
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:45,344
Frecons I would show people the three doors

611
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,368
Problem

612
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:48,416
Where the game show host says

613
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:54,048
His the rules of the game I got to hide a very desirable price here a National Rail Pass

614
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:57,632
Behind one of these three doors

615
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:04,544
The guys I was always explains the rules first before the game happens when the rules are I will hide the prize behind one of these doors

616
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:11,200
Then I will ask you the player to choose the door or you have a free choice and you choose it by naming it and we don't open

617
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:18,368
Then I began to host guarantee that I will open another of the doors not the one you chose

618
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:22,208
And I guarantee when I do that promise me promise you trust me

619
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:25,280
That the prize will not be revealed in that stage

620
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:32,704
So then the price will either behind dual 102 in this example

621
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:39,104
The other door that he didn't open and then the play I got the chance to stay

622
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,896
Take off switch if you want

623
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:45,248
And then you'll get what kind the final door you end up at

624
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:48,064
Either sticking or switching

625
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:50,112
And the options

626
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,648
For this puzzle van

627
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,512
What like that that was the rules being played tonight and now you go ahead and play the game

628
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,584
The player treated Obama The Host

629
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:05,216
Says in the rules I will not open these little two little three and will not reveal

630
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:07,520
The ugly little snowflake

631
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:09,312
It doesn't have a price

632
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:11,616
And the question is

633
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:13,664
Should you stick

634
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,992
Should you switch

635
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:22,368
How does it make no difference

636
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:30,304
I used to use this as my

637
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:36,960
Introductory example of a theory because people would argue very hotly about inside where it's either behind or one

638
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:39,520
Don't want it's 50/50

639
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,616
It is indeed oldest make any difference is 50/50

640
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:47,968
Another

641
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:53,856
Used to be contentious but unfortunately most people have heard of this puzzle

642
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:58,464
And so it doesn't really work anymore

643
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:01,024
Mitsubishi switch

644
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,632
They say it makes no difference so you say it's a useless educational device

645
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:10,496
Is being ruined because I was going to talk about it

646
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:16,128
And the really annoying thing is they talk about it in a way such that no one has actually nothing

647
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:23,296
And you are my proof of that because I'm going with ago you voted for a lot of you

648
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:28,160
Controversy hair between B and C

649
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:29,952
Cruise

650
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:37,120
Add educational disaster has happened to 3 Doors puzzle which is a fantastic puzzle it's really education

651
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:41,472
Being ruined because I know the answer but I don't understand it

652
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:48,384
ABC has these are exactly equivalent to each other the three Cubs and the three doors they all the same

653
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,920
Same problem as each other

654
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:50,944
And

655
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:57,344
Yet I showed you the same problem and you didn't get a ride even though you'd allegedly the answer

656
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,416
Learning isn't about memorizing things is my understanding

657
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:02,720
That's my little rant on the three doors

658
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,536
Stop

659
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:12,192
The message people should be getting from the three doors problem is don't memorize the answer to a stupid puzzle because then you'll be

660
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:18,592
Useless is holding featuring French problems instead learn the message that you should use probability Theory and then you will be

661
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:22,944
Equipsa solve any puzzle of the time in the future

662
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,224
Rent-A-Wreck

663
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:27,552
So what do we do now let's talk about

664
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:28,832
Noisy channels

665
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,232
What we're going to do with noisy channels is there always going to have an input and output

666
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,792
And a channel

667
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:42,400
Define recessive conditional distributions if you condition on an input

668
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:48,288
The channel to find the probability of the output is going to be the channel doesn't Define a joint distribution

669
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:51,104
Adjust Define unconditional

670
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,384
Distribution

671
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:58,783
And we can only have to do inference that the probability of everything so we need to Joint distribution

672
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:00,575
I'm going to run through

673
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:02,623
A very simple example wet

674
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:05,183
Assume I brought a joint distribution

675
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:15,423
Write down the joint distribution

676
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:17,983
And I'll Define some information measures

677
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:20,031
Pull that joint distribution

678
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:25,407
Then we move onto channels will have to guess a joint distribution by

679
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:29,247
Adding to the conditional distributions defined by the title

680
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:32,831
Add Distribution on the inputs to join up

681
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:36,671
I'll start with a joint distribution or a joint

682
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:37,951
Ensemble

683
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:42,559
Ant is an example of one

684
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:47,679
And I'll Define all the different information measures we can

685
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:48,703
Hot

686
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:55,359
Make for the joint Ensemble I'm going to tell you the joint probability of two random variables X and Y which are

687
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,127
Pendant

688
00:42:56,383 --> 00:43:00,479
Random variables a bit like the front in the back of the three cups

689
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:04,831
So the first variable X can take on values 1 2 3 or 4

690
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:08,415
Why can't I combine use one two three or four

691
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:12,255
On the joint probabilities are

692
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:16,863
181 6152

693
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,655
152

694
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:25,055
168 132

695
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:30,175
16

696
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:32,479
All lacrosse

697
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:35,807
Hyundai Azera

698
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:36,831
And there

699
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:42,207
From a joint distribution you can always Define marginals

700
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:44,767
Imaginal prophecies

701
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:48,095
All written in the margins

702
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:54,751
And they are trained by adding up until we have a quota quota

703
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:55,519
As it happens

704
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:57,311
For the probability of Y

705
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:00,383
And then in the boxing match and we have a

706
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:03,455
1/4 1/8

707
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,087
No

708
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:13,183
We already defined for a single random variable

709
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:14,975
How to measure entropy

710
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:21,631
And so when we go to join, so there's a bunch of straightforward things we can do with that entropy

711
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:22,911
Definition

712
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,383
We can write down what the

713
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:37,759
Marshall entropy of excess and we can write down what the marginal

714
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:40,575
Entropy of Y is for example

715
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:45,439
Some defining for youth by example

716
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,975
What muscle atrophy means

717
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:53,119
Muscle and relax is the entropy of this distribution here is 7 / 4

718
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:58,751
The most expensive why is the entropy of this distribution

719
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,799
And that's two bits

720
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:08,479
And we can find the entropy of the path XY so you could think of

721
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:12,575
The Pact why is being a single random variable that takes on these

722
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:16,415
16 possible values with the 16 probability swishing hair

723
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:18,463
How do you say what the entropy

724
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,487
Of this

725
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,023
Distribution

726
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:28,191
So we just do a normal some overall path X Y XY

727
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:30,239
Log base 2

728
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:33,055
I'll never see if X and Y

729
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:39,711
And that comes out to 27/8

730
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:42,271
Bits for this

731
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:44,063
Joint distribution

732
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:46,367
And

733
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:50,719
Those numbers I've just written down these three numbers have the property that if you show them

734
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:55,327
Graphically

735
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:57,887
Android select start way

736
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:04,287
An age of X and Y best way

737
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:07,103
I know you trying to make Hy

738
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:11,199
No jump against this Ryan side hair

739
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:18,367
Define they don't quite match up so late to vaccinate added together

740
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:20,159
Then h of X and Y

741
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,951
For this example

742
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:28,351
And this is actually always true that these guys will always have a laugh or they might just up

743
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:31,167
Up against each other and exactly add up to

744
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:32,191
The Joint entropy

745
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:36,287
They only have to do that if X and Y are independent

746
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,823
Random variables

747
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,383
So the size of this overlap hair

748
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:44,223
Is a measure of how much dependents there is between

749
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:45,759
The random variables

750
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:56,767
Let me Define a few more things we can do with a joint distribution we can Define conditional probability

751
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:04,959
For example payoff x given Y is

752
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:10,335
Define to be the joint probability of x + y / y

753
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:12,895
And

754
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:14,943
We can write it out

755
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:17,247
Parole 16

756
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:19,807
Values of X and Y

757
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:29,535
So here is Thanksgiving why

758
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:33,119
4y going from one to three

759
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:35,935
And ask I want to be free

760
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:42,335
. what condition on why being one then we can read that that top row probability

761
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:44,127
And normalize it

762
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:48,223
We got a 1/2 1/4 1/8 1/8

763
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:54,367
The next rogo's 1/4 or 1/8 1/8 when we normalize it

764
00:47:54,879 --> 00:48:01,023
Let me know like I said right that really cool so we get the quota quota quota

765
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:06,911
Why we don't like the bottom row we got one

766
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:12,543
So there's full probability vectors all the full possible conditional distributions

767
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:20,223
And for every one of those probability distributions we can write down its entropy so we can write down the entropy off

768
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:23,807
Given that Y is equal to 1

769
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:29,439
We can write a review of x given that y equals 2 and so forth

770
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:31,743
Identify this guy here

771
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:37,631
This distribution it's Valley Familia at 7 or before this one before as well

772
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:39,423
This one

773
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:43,007
Entry of the uniform distribution is two bits

774
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:46,335
The entropy of one and three zeros

775
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:51,967
Is there a bit cuz it's a certain distribution we know

776
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:55,039
Conditional why being attacked is definitely one

777
00:48:56,831 --> 00:49:00,927
So what do we think about that well we noticed that

778
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:02,463
It possible

779
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:05,791
For the conditional entropy of

780
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:06,559
X

781
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:09,119
Given a particular value of y

782
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:10,399
To be

783
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:15,007
The same as what we started with 7/4

784
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:16,543
All the same

785
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:18,335
Omega

786
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:19,615
Osmolar

787
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:21,663
So you when you get data

788
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:23,455
About why

789
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:28,831
It's possible for your uncertainty by X3 the go up stay the same or get less

790
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:32,671
So that's an interesting observation

791
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:38,815
On Sunday we can do it all of these is rickettsiae tall and average when we learn why

792
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:42,655
How much information content will ask then have

793
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:45,727
So what's the average entropy of x

794
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:52,127
Kevin Weiss I'm not defining for you I think old the conditional entropy

795
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:59,039
All of these were conditional antifreeze as well

796
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:06,719
Dua for particular condition in particular values of Y and then this is the really important on the conditional entropy

797
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:13,119
Which is the average averaging over all possible values of Y waiting together

798
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:19,519
Kayavax given that value of y no just I'm Catholic consistently using little lie to me

799
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:22,847
Thinking about you and Capitol why is the name of

800
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,663
The random variable itself

801
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:31,295
Okay I'm not adds up to 11/8

802
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:32,831
Bets

803
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:40,511
Similarly we can work out what the entropy of Y given X is

804
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:44,351
Similarly

805
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:49,727
Go to calculation I need at 13/8

806
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:52,031
Specs

807
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:54,335
No

808
00:50:57,663 --> 00:51:03,807
In this case I pointed out that the entropy of Acts when you learn while I could stay the same could go up

809
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:04,831
Could go down

810
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:09,439
When we went. The conditional entropy Wego 11/8 bits

811
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:12,767
And that is smaller than 7/4

812
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:16,351
And let me know tell you I serum

813
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:19,679
Which is that it is always the case

814
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:26,079
That the conditional entropy with capital letters is less than or equal to 2 module entropy

815
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:32,479
And finally it can all be glued together like this in a single diagram

816
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:37,343
So this is nothing. Yes but it's true

817
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:41,951
But h of Y given X

818
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:46,047
8tracks

819
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:49,375
Kevin why

820
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:59,615
Unless we have Robin icewood stories that we can tell which is the total information that you got when you learn X and Y

821
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:06,015
Is the some of the information you get when you learn why plus the amount of information you then at when having already

822
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:08,319
Why can't you then go on to the next

823
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:15,231
Or information about the backs of why on average is intuition

824
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:16,511
Explaining why

825
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:18,815
Okay but some of these two

826
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:26,751
I'm disabled iPad dependence between these variables

827
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:33,919
Relationship I just said about this publicity clean that some people call it the chain rule

828
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:35,455
For entropy

829
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:41,599
The final thing I want to do is Define this creature half

830
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:47,231
This measure of dependence between X and Y is going to be a lot of fun

831
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:49,791
When we play with channels

832
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:55,423
The most important thing we want to know and it's called the mutual information

833
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:57,215
Between

834
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:59,263
The random variables X and Y

835
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:03,615
Waco of X semicolon

836
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:04,383
Why

837
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:06,943
And

838
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:11,039
It's what it shows in the picture so you can pick any way of

839
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:17,695
Obtaining this from the picture examples the difference between a touch of Acts and a Chevette

840
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:18,975
NY

841
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:23,583
Or it's the difference between

842
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:25,631
Hrvy

843
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:29,471
And make the volume max

844
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:36,127
That's 3 transformation

845
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:42,015
What we're going to do in the next election

846
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:45,087
Is glue this together with a channel

847
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:46,879
A channel

848
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:49,695
Is a set of conditional distributions

849
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:54,047
Sorry for the binary symmetric Channel

850
00:53:55,583 --> 00:54:01,727
It doesn't specify how often you should use the zero and the one it just says if you send a zero

851
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:06,591
If you send a 1

852
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:09,663
For the child to find conditional distributions

853
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:16,319
And then we can turn those conditional distributions if we want to enjoy joint Distribution on input and output

854
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:19,903
By inventing a probability distribution for the input

855
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:24,511
Then you can compute all of these information measures for the joint distribution you've to find

856
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:29,119
Remind me about the theory of how to communicate reliably

857
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:30,399
Urbanology Channel

858
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:32,959
Are there any questions

859
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:37,823
Okay thanks very much for coming and see you next week

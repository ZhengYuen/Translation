1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:05,376
Thank you all for coming

2
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:09,472
Let me recap what we did last time

3
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:14,336
We've started talking about sore skirting Alternatives data compression

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,664
We've been looking at toy examples

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,064
One example of a redundant file for us to say something is mainly zeros with just a few ones

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,392
Scattered at random are we cool at the bent coin

7
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:31,744
How should we can compress a file like that

8
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:38,400
Well when we think about compression to claims with examining Shannon's assertions that

9
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:40,192
If you take log

10
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:41,216
Bass tooth

11
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:45,056
Of 1 over the probability of an outcome that tells you

12
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:51,456
, information content that outcome has Galt how long the message or to be associate

13
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:55,552
Chicken piccata outcome in bits as well as the ideal message length

14
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
The entropy which is the average of the Shannon information content is claimed to be the right way to measure average information

15
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:03,488
Content

16
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,024
And

17
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,424
The third is session that we've got time that we have sort of proof last time is the source coating Theron which says that

18
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,568
If you got a very long string around comes from a random Source identically distributed

19
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:22,688
Then those outcomes can be compressed into roughly end times the entropy bits

20
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,344
So we sort of proof that last time we did this proof by counting the

21
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,672
Typical said we didn't have to do a general proof that's in the book

22
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:36,512
But what we did was we looked at a special case of the bent coin

23
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:40,864
Where are you I'll sit and times and get mainly zeros in a few ones

24
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:47,520
And that we all know what the typical sat is you expect to get roughly if it was

25
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:53,920
I've been calling me to buy September 7th at 10% and the typical set of strings is old

26
00:01:54,176 --> 00:02:00,320
Things that have roughly 10% 107 general what the typical set means

27
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:03,136
Define concept

28
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,160
Is

29
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:10,048
If you got the string of an independent outcomes from a source that string

30
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:12,608
Is very likely to be in a typical set

31
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:17,216
Typical set elements all have roughly the same probability as each other

32
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:17,984
And

33
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,544
There are two to the end times and repeat

34
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,312
All of them

35
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:27,712
So the rough proof of the source coding thermostat to each of these guys the number

36
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:34,112
Names of your meat has two Phantoms the entropy so the length of all the names Weeknd X the entropy

37
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:40,512
The old got roughly the same probability of each other which must that will be to the minus and times

38
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,560
The

39
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:48,960
Very rough outline of the proof of the souls cutting tempura General Tso

40
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:54,592
And we did it for the bent coin looking at a long string of and

41
00:02:55,104 --> 00:03:01,248
Outcomes and the way we found ourselves at the proof was reimagined playing the band Korn lost

42
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:07,648
We wanted to win the lottery for the mafia boss how much of his money did we need to spend which tickets

43
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:14,048
It would be by we found a big sack full of tickets and then we imagined writing a new name

44
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:20,448
Increase ticket on the robust of a ticket we counted the number of tickets in the bag and had to to the end times the entropy

45
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:26,848
So that's what we did last time I was out proof of the source coding theorem at least for the band coin

46
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:41,184
When I said the number of tickets in the bag is 2 to the end times end

47
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,768
2 to the Anton phanpy plus a little bit

48
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:51,168
And that little bit is to the fluctuations around the the mean of the typical number

49
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:57,568
Of Wands those fluctuations goes √ and where and is the length of the

50
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:03,968
The strength they get relatively small compared to the main term and H2

51
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:10,368
And his just a picture reminding you want to go see him distribution looks like and you can get the probability

52
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,672
State Farm down

53
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:19,071
As small as you like the probability of failure as small as you like just by adding a few extra √ Anton's

54
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,375
A few extra standard deviations

55
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,423
To your typical fast

56
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:30,847
All right so that was a ridiculous way to do compression with an older very large bean bag full of tickets

57
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:37,247
What you wrote things on the two signs off that was out compression on done compression algorithm

58
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,783
We're going to discuss

59
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,807
Practical

60
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:43,647
Data compression how would we compress a bent coin

61
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:49,791
Practically well that's actually a home of exercise I sent for you so I'd like you to work on that

62
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:56,191
But we'll carry on working on other approaches to related problems I'm going to talk today about

63
00:04:56,447 --> 00:05:01,055
A method of being data compression code symbol codes

64
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:06,943
I'm out here with symbol code is it something you could apply for example to English

65
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:13,343
Or to any language that involves an alphabet of characters West some characters

66
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,879
Probable than others

67
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:21,279
And to make life especially simple to start with I'm going to pretend that the probability distribution for every character

68
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:24,863
The same every time I'm that we know that distribution

69
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:31,263
And will usually assume that it's non-uniform distribution could look like his

70
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:37,663
Alphabet of 26 + 27 + oil and a probability distribution

71
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:44,063
Overdose nicotine space is the most probable time to ETA oan

72
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:50,463
RSI HDL will that sort of stuff this is like an English language distribution

73
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,791
And the task now is

74
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:54,815
To give

75
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:58,143
A code word to each of these

76
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:01,471
Symbols in the alphabet which which of these

77
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:07,871
Elements of the alphabet example of binary

78
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:14,271
And we've given a yacoba at four zeros and we can set the code of 11012

79
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,831
Walnuts basically 01

80
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:23,487
The last example of a code and the way you use a symbol code is you take the source file

81
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:27,839
Replace it by the corresponding codewords in order concatenated

82
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:34,239
With no punctuation at all so the receiver won't be able to see where the boundaries between the code webs

83
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:39,103
Sir

84
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,039
A symbol code is going to be a map

85
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,879
From each symbol

86
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,999
Acts in your alphabet

87
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:02,655
To will collect see all apps and see if x is a binary string

88
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:14,687
That's consejeria can be of any length and set notation

89
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:22,111
01 IS300 Wong set with a plus mean

90
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:26,975
The strings of any length made up of zeros and ones

91
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:32,351
Not may be familiar to those of you who hang out with computer scientists

92
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:36,447
Let me give you another example 01

93
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:43,103
^ 2 is the same as the set of strings

94
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:47,711
I'm going to walk like I said that's just a little bit of station

95
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:50,015
Assemble code is

96
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:54,367
A map from symbols to find restrings and then

97
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,695
The way sample code works is we encode

98
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:03,071
String of outcomes X1 X2 X3

99
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:09,215
Send biking caffeinating without punctuation

100

Tacoma glass racks wall

101

Makoto

102
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,527
Sorry

103
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:29,183
I'll just give you the example

104
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,999
If we gave

105
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,791
A recorder

106
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,071
1

107
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,631
See the code

108
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:41,215
I'm c1011 then

109
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:47,615
The file containing c a b b with zinc coated as long as ra1100

110
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,199
Sarah

111
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,991
Okay

112
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:59,391
That's a very simple idea but not many tickets are head round assemble Coast understand them theoretically

113
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:05,791
And understanding practically and these are quite important that quite widely used especially in

114
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,327
History

115
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:16,031
So the questions you want to ask today all the theoretical question

116
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:21,407
How well might a symbol code before

117
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:33,695
I'm over on fizzle biting here is maybe the answer will have something to do with

118
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:36,767
With the entropy and Shannon information content

119
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:40,351
And I would again reinforce the claims we being

120
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,119
Assessing

121
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:47,519
Question is hey stuff. I just want to know how to make a good one how do you make

122
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,311
Good symbol codes

123
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:55,967
Let me say good or optimal

124
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:59,551
We need to Define what we mean by

125
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:06,207
So let's do that

126
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,535
Suck

127
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:15,167
What do you mean by optional well after compression a short expected

128
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:21,311
Like stomach so we'll use that was our main objective function so that maybe others

129
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,383
Define the expected length

130
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,663
All

131
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,455
Barcode

132
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,991
See

133
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,551
For an ensemble

134
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:38,463
Axe The Ensemble being the alphabet with all its probability

135
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:46,911
Will Define it to be LLC and X is some over all the elements in

136
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,191
Alphabet

137
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,495
I'm applying for the city of

138
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,287
The outcome

139
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:58,687
By the links that you have assigned with l i is the length in

140
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,479
Solve

141
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,343
The codes that you've assigned to the eye

142
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:11,231
I don't think nothing profound defining expected length

143
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:14,303
And it's probably a good idea to immediately

144
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,839
Here's an example

145
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:34,015
Alphabet alphabets going to be

146
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,855
And let's have a probability distribution

147
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:44,511
Quota 1818

148
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:50,911
This is a toy property distribution with uneven probabilities

149
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,727
I think we might want to know about this

150
00:11:53,983 --> 00:12:00,127
I'm so humble is what is it

151
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:04,479
2 + 1/8 * 3 + 8

152
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,759
X

153
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,039
3

154
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:13,183
Phase 1 2 3 and 3 being respectively the logs base to office this

155
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:22,143
Cannot is one of the

156
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,959
So

157
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:32,895
Let's give ourselves a symbol code and then try and make it better and we need

158
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:36,735
Depend on what the rules of the game are actually done trying to be half

159
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:43,647
So what do we want let's let's defiantly

160
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,439
The rules

161
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,047
First and then look at some examples

162
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:59,519
Restoril is it had better work when someone codes of this and then someone else and decodes the better get back

163
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:03,615
What we first put must be

164
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:10,015
We wanted to decode correctly

165
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:17,951
We wanted to guarantee to decode correctly not just have a 99.9%

166
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:21,535
Fight Goods in a slightly silly approach of last time

167
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:24,863
We wanted to always decode correctly

168
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:34,591
Let's just run around the rules and then I'll say a bit more precisely what we what we mean by 5's

169
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:40,479
Ideally we'd like it to be easy to decode as well so we don't want to have

170
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,527
The recipient having test

171
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:48,927
Spend hours staring at the code book trying to figure out where the punctuation where the missing punctuation

172
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:52,255
In the in this receive string

173
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:56,607
So easy to decode would be nice to have

174
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:03,263
But it's not essential if if we can get a big win on this final objective which is

175
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,103
Small owl

176
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,455
Okay

177
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:17,599
Let's just be precise about what we mean by it's gone to the code right we want the code to be

178
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:22,719
Uniquely decodable

179
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:30,143
So when you receive an encoded string there should be no ambiguity about what was sent

180
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:30,911
Stop

181
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,703
4

182
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,495
Annie

183
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:37,311
String X

184
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:40,383
And any other string why

185
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,431
Such that

186
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,503
X is not the same as why

187
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,575
We want the encoding

188
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:51,391
All facts not equal

189
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,927
Man cutting

190
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,207
Have life

191
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:57,279
That's the definition of unique dakotabilities

192
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,263
Okay

193
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:13,663
Just to check my no texting is clear

194
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:20,063
City of AI is the way we encode a particular element of the alphabet and then you have see all the

195
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:26,463
Spring-like acts that just a concatenation of X1 X2

196
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:31,583
Overloading the symbol C to me neither

197
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,191
The way that you encode a single symbol or it could be the encoding of an entire string

198
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,567
Alright okay let's define

199
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:48,223
Some symbol codes and have a think about these objectives what does it mean to say

200
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:52,575
What does that imply how do we catch a small expected length

201
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:55,647
Is this a good start for English

202
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:58,463
Could it be my best is it uniquely decodable

203
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:05,887
Let's look at these simple example s Define a code code C1 and it's code

204
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,167
Weather going to be

205
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,471
1 and 3 zeros

206
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,519
Is there a 100

207
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,335
0010

208
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,919
Please Arizona

209
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:24,319
Not deliberately made them oil for characters long cuz now we know the recipient will be able to put the punctuation

210
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:30,719
Expected length

211
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:34,815
Expected length

212
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,911
All right

213
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:42,495
Can we improve on this is this is this the best

214
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,775
Possible

215
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:46,079
Code for this

216
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,615
Ensemble

217
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,151
Any suggestions

218
00:16:56,831 --> 00:17:01,951
Should we get rid of some of those arrows

219
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,743
Would that work

220
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,607
Who have been shot today

221
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:13,727
Get rid of the trailing zeros brilliant thank you

222
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:18,079
Okay so we remove all the trailing zeros

223
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:28,063
Then the recipient will still be able to figure out where the punctuation marks or to be

224
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,159
Because I can just look for the Wang Wang comes at the end of any code what

225
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:39,071
Right but it's still sell punctuating and it's easy to decode cuz it just read along to the Head

226
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:45,471
It must have been a sea or whatever whenever I have got to

227
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:51,871
Expected length of this while I would do that for you in advance its 1.875

228
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:54,175
1 + 7/8

229
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:59,551
That's a nice idea

230
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:07,487
Can we get the expected length on a shorter how about

231
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:11,071
How about this one how about

232
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,119
That code

233
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:19,519
What the expected length of this song

234
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,127
It's like you like this one

235
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,151
Okay

236
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,943
Is eating edible

237
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,759
Maybe not because

238
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:36,159
Even very short strings may have the same encodings each other is not negotiable

239
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,743
The goal is to get the expected length very short

240
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,863
Oso

241
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:48,447
Can we do any better than than this one well

242
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:56,127
How about this we need to have have a bit more like they're going to be a bit different from each other

243
00:18:56,383 --> 00:19:00,991
That's one of the road tax deduction from the rule 800

244
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,527
Photos must be different

245
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:11,743
And that's the consequence of

246
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,279
You need to go to Boise

247
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:20,447
Different 0 1 0

248
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,007
+ 1/0

249
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,103
The

250
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:32,479
Expected length of this is one on 5/8

251
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:40,415
Expected length is there's a chance of a ha of

252
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:47,839
Akula for this 808

253
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:51,935
Where do they come from expected length is

254
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:55,263
There's a half chance of getting a length of 1

255
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:58,847
Lacrosse chance of Atlanta 2

256
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:04,479
Plus I want a chance of 3 + 1/8 chance of

257
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,503
Food

258
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,551
And then I added that it up

259
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:08,831
All right

260
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:13,951
What's the average length of a given that the lynx are going to be

261
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,743
Length

262
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:18,047
I want to free

263
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,583
Huntik

264
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:23,935
Questions

265
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:28,543
So what do you think of this guy

266
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:31,103
Encode something

267
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,407
Chauffeur expected length

268
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:37,247
Example who flipped out so far

269
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:45,439
Batman code something with it c a a b

270
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,743
Encoded with

271
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,815
Code number 3

272
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:01,311
My man Courvoisier baby we dance

273
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,895
Guam

274
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:07,967
Wang

275
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:09,503
Mom

276
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:20,000
So is C4

277
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,792
Easy to decode

278
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,096
Is it uniquely decodable

279
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:34,080
What we're trying to do here is so sale close to the wind we want to make or Cobra the shortest possible

280
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,384
We don't want to close

281
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,200
Have problems of unique dakotabilities

282
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:39,968
What's up

283
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,784
Is this uniquely decodable

284
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:47,136
I could stare hard at this and I'm trying to figure out

285
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:53,792
Is this a mother interpretation so you read along a 01 how could you get zero

286
00:21:54,048 --> 00:22:00,192
Has to be a c doesn't say so thank God

287
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:03,008
This one

288
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:03,776
Bong

289
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:10,176
There a what could be that I was thinking I'll look in the code book Maybe

290
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:13,760
Who looked at it could be an A and an a

291
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,576
And then

292
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,344
Baby

293
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,904
But it could have been

294
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:24,768
Maybe it was a

295
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,560
Hey Ya

296
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:30,656
And the one is there a d

297
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,704
Mendoza's zero

298
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,752
From somewhere

299
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,384
So it's difficult to decode cuz I am not quite sure it is especially if we haven't

300
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:42,432
Reached the end yet

301
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,480
Don't play what's going on

302
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:48,320
Can anyone give us a proof

303
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,904
Preferred mini find two strings that have exactly the same

304
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:55,488
BC I got so if you

305
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,768
Encode

306
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,816
DC

307
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:02,656
That gives u0103

308
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:05,472
DC-10

309
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:09,312
010 ik and

310
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:12,896
It had got another string that also includes house

311
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:18,528
A b c d e f

312
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,552
1

313
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,600
00

314
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:26,720
Well I'm there at 12 okay sorry if you're cool with x

315
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:33,120
And that's why the difference between encoding

316
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:36,960
This is useless no bootable

317
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,288
So what's going on

318
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:43,360
Let's get ourselves one more example

319
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,432
She finds

320
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,736
His C5

321
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:52,064
00

322
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,600
Is there a long

323
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,392
1 0

324
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,184
On what

325
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:03,328
Expected length of this is

326
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,120
Sarah Lancaster

327
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:09,984
So that's not as good as this one

328
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,712
I found it to be a few more

329
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:24,320
So don't go any further ideas

330
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,112
Any ways we can improve yeah

331
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,280
Haha

332
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:36,864
So you're suggesting take C2

333
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,704
And treat the last word so I got C6

334
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,264
Using wang Vera Wang

335
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:49,664
Is there a Vera Wang but you're saying you don't actually need that final punctuation time won't you sing

336
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,944
3 zeros

337
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,760
If you're using C2 you know a woman is coming next

338
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,552
They can get rid of it

339
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:02,464
Write a text of the length of 1 2 3 on 3

340
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:06,048
Which incidentally

341
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:11,936
All the same as the Shannon information contents let's go Shi

342
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:16,032
One bit two bits leave it simply this

343
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,432
So expected length

344
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:28,576
Which is average of blank is going to be the same as the average of the contents

345
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:33,696
Class 1 and 3/4 which is Santa Fe

346
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:41,632
Right that's a fun idea we got a symbol code who's expected length is the entropy

347
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:44,960
If we encode c a a b

348
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,240
This

349
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:48,544
Then we got

350
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,336
Girls hair long

351
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,360
Wall

352
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:52,640
Guam

353
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,944
01

354
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:03,136
Interesting thing to notice that this

355
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:08,256
Set a Cota has lots of zeros in a few Wong to make it any better

356
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:14,144
Visit unit 2 decodable

357
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:17,984
Can I don't give an argument why it must be you need to be to go to bowl

358
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:20,544
What's up already set at

359
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:29,504
You're being shy how the receiver can read along

360
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:32,832
And look at the code code book

361
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:36,160
Once they reach the end of

362
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:42,560
About as well as in the cookbook nothing else would have happened you can reach you can't get through

363
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:47,936
A different code word on the way to the Cobra the are actually fixing off

364
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:51,520
No code way to the prefix of any other

365
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,544
Code word

366
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:58,944
So this code this is a prefix

367
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,480
Code is the

368
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:06,624
Name against this no

369
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,416
Code realize

370
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:11,744
Is a prefix of a Nyala

371
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:20,448
We don't have to use

372
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:23,520
Prefix codes but it makes them easy to decode

373
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:29,920
Another property of a prefix code is you can arrange the code Woods in a tree

374
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:36,320
The branches in the tree of the decision is the next Doctor going to be a 0 or 1 and

375
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:42,720
Each step in the tree really keep going or you stopped because you found a code word so in this one

376
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:47,840
Go down to one branch and you start when you found the code with a which is

377
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:56,544
Go this way 0.10 followed by 1 then you can be

378
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,640
Which is included with Vera Wang

379
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:06,528
The symbols we soar as we went along those branches we keep going down here

380
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,064
Chrissy

381
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,344
This is d

382
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,512
All right

383
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,840
I'm going to give you just one

384
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:23,680
Call code enforcement board

385
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:26,496
What's protection

386
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:28,288
Whatever

387
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:35,200
Let me Define

388
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:37,248
Another code C7

389
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:47,232
It look like a swamp 10100

390
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:49,024
000

391
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,584
I've deliberately chosen this one

392
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:57,984
Because it's not a prefix for a is a prefix

393
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,776
4B and 4C

394
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:00,800
Right

395
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:12,832
That's not a prefix code which means it may be a bit of a headache to decode

396
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:21,280
If you receive a Wong and you know some more stuff is coming and he was Evil Zero what was going on

397
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:26,144
Play the Beav we stopped to eat another zero you still there

398
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,776
I still don't know what's going on

399
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:38,176
Maybe when a woman comes along then maybe you can figure out whether the first and goal was and I a b or c

400
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:39,968
Okay

401
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:45,088
So we don't like this cuz it's not the code

402
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:48,416
Is it actually you need to decodable

403
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,464
Yes why

404
00:29:56,352 --> 00:30:02,496
Okay so if you reverse these full code words they all the same as the code was a C6

405
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:04,032
Is uniquely decodable

406
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:10,432
If this one will not uniquely decodable that would mean it has got to code Words which

407
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:16,832
Sorry to strings x and y whose encodings are identical to each other

408
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,392
Hand

409
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:21,696
You would have found yourself a pair of

410
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:22,976
Strings

411
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:25,536
What type of sign code would I wear for this code

412
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:30,400
And we know that's impossible because this one is uniquely decodable

413
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:33,728
But we don't like it cuz it's not the prefix code

414
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:37,056
This is

415
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:39,616
Edible

416
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:45,504
Rut so one of the ideas with floating now is easy to the code

417
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,112
Could mean for example that we'd like a prefix code please

418
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:53,696
But we really do want small expected length

419
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:10,592
Let me suggest that I did now about how we get small expected length

420
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:21,088
We found a coat hair which was speculating could be the best you can do

421
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:23,392
For this Ensemble with a symbol code

422
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:29,792
Because I already heard some serums about not being able to do better than that

423
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:32,608
And it has the property

424
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:39,264
Here's a key intuition about symbol codes and is over all of their commercial property

425
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:43,872
Short code words to the probable outcomes and longer code words

426
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:47,200
To the last probable once that's what it's all about

427
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:54,624
I'm not supposable guess about how we might get the smallest possible

428
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,904
Expected life

429
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:00,512
We could say hello you give me a list of them and I'll give

430
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:03,840
The shortest possible code word

431
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:07,680
Handle and steadily longer covert as we go down the list

432
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:11,008
How to chat to your neighbor and see what you think of that idea

433
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:19,200
Stop suggested and I did the right spirit is giving short

434
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,736
Code words

435
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:24,064
The probable outcomes

436
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,880
Some long ones the last purple ones

437
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:29,184
Is that going to work or can anyone

438
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,976
Criticize that for us

439
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:38,400
If you got a huge number symbols fan watch

440
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,704
It might not be good

441
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,984
It's definitely not good

442
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:45,824
Probably not okay

443
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:49,664
I might agree with you

444
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:54,528
Let me give you some backup for your intuition there

445
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:57,600
We found a case where this

446
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:04,000
Proposed algorithm is getting us to the interface that would be too critical of it but maybe we can find a counterexample

447
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:10,400
It doesn't it doesn't work it doesn't need to be among stuff example

448
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:16,800
Can give the mole a probability of a quota except just to make life interesting will add Absalom

449
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:23,456
One of them and I that Sloan Iowa to Towanda subtract Epsilon able to from this one

450
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:26,784
A billion

451
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:30,112
Feather all essentially they will have a probability of 1/4

452
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,392
All right

453
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:33,696
And now we apply this

454
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:37,280
Suggested algorithm end up with

455
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:38,816
And the rest

456
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:40,096
C6

457
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,120
All right

458
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:44,448
So is that a new probability distribution

459
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:50,592
When you use code 6 which is proposed planets other than expected length

460
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:51,872
Fat is

461
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:55,200
The length of a 1/2

462
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:58,272
Three-on-three is the last one in the list

463
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:04,672
And the average of those since the Rolex the Pro Bowl

464
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:09,536
9/4 riches to

465
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:14,400
And 1/4 bits is that the optimal symbol code

466
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:17,728
How are you better how

467
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:25,920
Dc5 and expected length will be to

468
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,736
QED

469
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:31,552
Suck

470
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:40,512
But the length of C5

471
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:42,560
Repeat

472
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:44,864
Right

473
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:51,264
So we can just use that simple rulers got the right Spirit we need to identify some so

474
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,544
The trade-off of

475
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:54,592
When do you give

476
00:34:55,104 --> 00:35:01,248
Short code words to the most purple guy recognizing

477
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:05,088
But when we decide to not give him or length two words

478
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:09,440
If one of them. Select one then some others longer

479
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:16,096
But like when you put a glove glove for the watering squeeze of your the fingers

480
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:21,216
The other ones have to get together some sort of conserved quantity looking in there

481
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:30,432
And that can conserve has to do with unique dakotabilities if we allowed ourselves to shorts and some of

482
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:36,832
The words and didn't like the others longer it looks like we lose unique unique dakotabilities

483
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:40,928
I've lost bored as well that's why I missed

484
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:48,608
I think the time has come for me to reveal how this rubber glove work

485
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:52,192
The constraint of you need to coat ability

486
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,472
What's

487
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:58,336
Siletz rifle through a way of thinking about this

488
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:01,920
If

489
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:07,808
I only use code words of a particular length how many of them can I have

490
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:08,576
Well

491
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:11,648
If all my code was

492
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:14,208
Have length

493
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:23,424
Al

494
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,960
2 then

495
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,496
I can have

496
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,520
411

497
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:31,104
Evo my CO2 at a blank free I can have a h

498
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:38,272
Schumacher sc11 can have two today

499
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,296
Open

500
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:46,208
That I was changing the size of the alphabet and noticing that I have long words

501
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:49,536
I can have more of an exponentially more often

502
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,376
And

503
00:36:54,144 --> 00:37:00,288
Here is the idea that raps this up and is consistent with everything we've seen so far

504
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:03,104
You can think of each code word

505
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,480
At some length l

506
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:12,320
Have a Costless course

507
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:16,160
To Salina South

508
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:21,024
I'm overdoing it's going to the symbol coating supermarket

509
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:29,984
Are all the different styles of a supermarket you can pick any code with you want

510
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,312
Is the entire set of all conceivable coconuts

511
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:37,408
Annie's choice because it might not be uniquely decodable

512
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:44,064
And I've arranged to denial for a child has which of the same length

513
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,928
Choices and the size of the package for each cobras in heading how much it'll cost you

514
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:55,840
So you can budget of one which is in light of the supermarket you can buy

515
00:37:56,096 --> 00:38:02,240
These two cobras if you want to sit on the wall and then you're done you can't add any more code words of any length because they'd be

516
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:06,592
Or you can have these people

517
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,640
Y8

518
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:12,224
We've seen a bunch of things you can also have

519
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,784
You can pay those thought I was code number one

520
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:22,208
And you haven't exceeded your budget and that's uniquely decodable the fact that you haven't exceeded your but it doesn't guarantee the

521
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:24,256
It's uniquely decodable

522
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:30,656
Definitely if you go over your budget of Wong then it wouldn't be uniquely decodable so what we

523
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:32,704
Is the following assertion

524
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:36,544
That's right

525
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:41,664
If a code is uniquely decodable

526
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,968
Then

527
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:51,648
The Constable code words has to be less than your budget some of us Ally must be less than or equal to

528
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:54,976
Wall these are the costs of goods

529
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,256
That's your budget

530
00:38:57,024 --> 00:39:00,352
I miss is called the crafting equality

531
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,912
And it's true

532
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:08,800
Haven't proved it I just told you it and the proof is in the book

533
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:11,104
So if you're interested in a proof

534
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:13,152
It's in the textbook

535
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:19,808
So this is what you didn't dakotabilities implies you got to stay within your budget

536
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:24,416
So that was code Wong and we have some other ideas

537
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:26,976
It was code number five

538
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:30,816
That was the selection that we made

539
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:31,584
With

540
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,608
Code

541
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,656
Play I want it

542
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,264
CO2

543
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:44,896
Re-stuffing of everybody but it didn't quite you that the whole budget cuts on noticed we could

544
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:48,736
Make a change instead of buying the there is everyone

545
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:50,272
Code Red Rock.

546
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:56,672
We could love find a Woman by The 000 next door instead I'm not made the expected like shorter which is good

547
00:39:56,928 --> 00:40:03,072
And then we looked at this guy was my silly idea

548
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:06,912
Sorry I buy that 100 * 1

549
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:08,448
Budget

550
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:16,128
And it was a great Labor to find a proof it went that it didn't work and have to think about strength

551
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:25,856
No point even trying this thing it's violated Unity decodable

552
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:32,512
All right in blue that we have the optimal code

553
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,072
And here is

554
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:42,752
C7 which I want golf which is why we reverse told him so this is also uniquely decodable

555
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:49,152
The difference between the prefix code in blue which is little sense with walkthrough

556
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:52,480
Buying code with that you wouldn't confuse with each other

557
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:55,552
Flatout facility back to front one

558
00:40:56,576 --> 00:41:02,720
C61 10100 which are prefixes of each other and their own

559
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:05,792
Y coordinates in this in this picture

560
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:07,584
All right

561
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,656
So that's the question coffee and

562
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:12,960
A code that

563
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:16,800
Step right up to the budget that uses the full budget

564
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:20,128
We will call a complete

565
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:21,408
Code

566
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:39,584
I complete code is one that has sum of 2 - lite2

567
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,120
Wow

568
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:48,544
If you haven't chosen yourself a complete code the advice is you can probably go back to the supermarket makes me switches

569
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,080
I got yourself shorter

570
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:53,407
Code there's a bit silly not to use a complete card

571
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,711
All right

572
00:41:55,967 --> 00:42:00,575
I love you too easy to decode codes off prefix codes

573
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,647
So

574
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:12,607
Let's address the Practical question

575
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,143
Very first practice

576
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:16,959
Next 5 minutes

577
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:21,055
The theoretical question is how well can we do

578
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,079
With

579
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,895
Symbol codes

580
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:27,199
So if I give you any ensemble

581
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:31,807
Axe and if you come up with the best symbol code by whatever method

582
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:34,367
How small can expected length

583
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:41,791
Are the definition of expected length is Samurai GI

584
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:42,815
L i

585
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:49,727
We're not going to show that whatever you do

586
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:55,615
Where the symbol code you can't beat the entropy I'm willing to identify what you need to do in order to get

587
00:42:56,127 --> 00:43:00,223
Close to the edge people all the way to the entropy of

588
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:03,551
Figure out what these expected length should be

589
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:06,879
Like me to give us a clue

590
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:08,927
Define

591
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:12,255
The ideal

592
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:14,559
Length

593
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:20,447
Spokeo glad to be one of the prophecy

594
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:22,751
I'm going to

595
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:26,847
Introduce a definition

596
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:33,247
So I say let's assume the civil code or to be using those

597
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:36,319
Making a definition and then we'll end up with a proof

598
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:42,719
What's the ideal length

599
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:45,791
Now if you rearrange this

600
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:49,375
And if you imagine that someone has picked

601
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:56,799
Some light L I may or may not be the ideal length you can use those simile to Define

602
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:59,871
Some implicit probabilities

603
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:01,663
So which those

604
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:05,247
Chosen lights would be the ideal length

605
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:11,903
But thanks though we've defined our relationship to relax and probabilities in this way and I'm going to pull the implicit problem

606
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:24,191
Implicit probiotic you that you can get from whatever lengths you have come up with

607
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:27,775
Will B22 - l i

608
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:30,079
Except

609
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:36,479
You maybe didn't choose a complete code so maybe the sum of all of these isn't warm which would be

610
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:41,855
So I'm going to / the appropriate Zedd

611
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:43,647
Where

612
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,951
That is

613
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:48,511
Sum of 2 to the - Al

614
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:55,167
Which will be worn if it is a complete code one if you've made a sensible

615
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:56,959
A trip to the supermarket

616
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:00,287
But it could be smaller than wall

617
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:06,943
Note

618
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:14,367
That will be less than or equal to 1 for any

619
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:17,951
And that equals 1/4 a complete code

620
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:25,375
Right

621
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,935
What does that mean

622
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:34,591
Well it means lii the links that you chosen a low base to war mode

623
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:38,431
Qi - locations vent

624
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:44,319
I know I can plug this into out

625
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:48,415
Sal is summer i p i

626
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:50,463
Where's. Lovelace tooth

627
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:53,023
Wonton qi

628
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:56,351
Minus log base 2 of

629
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:58,143
Then

630
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:04,287
Sorry my board hygiene isn't very good today

631
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:17,343
Okay wouldn't it be great if it said some of P log 1 / p

632
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:24,767
So let's do that sound like log base 2

633
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:31,167
That's not true anymore so we need to add on the appropriate things that is true

634
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:36,799
Log p over Q

635
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:40,639
Looking at the end some of Pi is warm so we can

636
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:41,919
Suck the dog

637
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:43,711
That out of a summation

638
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,759
Right

639
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:47,039
We've got somewhere

640
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:50,111
If you pick any symbol code to Tool

641
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:54,463
Then it's expected length will equal the entry

642
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:55,999
Plus something

643
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:57,791
Plus something else

644
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:04,959
Let's give it a name for colace kullback leibler Divergence between p and Q

645
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:08,031
And

646
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:10,079
His little theorem

647
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:17,503
Some of the log P / 222 distribution of p and Q

648
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:22,623
Is Greg Hunter

649
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:29,279
And it's one of the most important inequalities of information Theory

650
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:32,607
With the quality

651
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:37,215
Only

652
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:39,519
2 is equal to

653
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:43,615
I love that we already know

654
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:49,503
Is less is less than or equal to 1/2 lug that

655
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:56,159
Is less than or equal to zero and minus logs that is greater than or equal to 0 with a quality

656
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:02,047
Only if the code

657
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,351
Is

658
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:05,887
Completes

659
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:12,543
Straighten wrinkled if the code is uniquely decodable

660
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:14,591
With equality only if it's complete

661
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,127
So this is true

662
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:17,407
For any code

663
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,943
For any symbol code

664
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:25,855
So what we have just proved is that the expected length

665
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:32,255
Not the best we've shown what you need to do in or

666
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:38,655
Go to to get to the entropy you need your PT equal York you so you should be using

667
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:40,191
Implicit probabilities

668
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:43,007
Equal to probability

669
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:46,335
So your length should be the information content

670
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:49,151
So you got a quality

671
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:53,503
The lengths you're using

672
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:56,831
Persona in formation Campana

673
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:00,415
And you got the complete code

674
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:05,279
Which will happen for free when you do that

675
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:06,815
Okay

676
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:13,215
So what are we done we still have proved a source coding theorem for symbol codes we're showing that you should be

677
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:19,615
Using the Shannon information code contents to set to code websites if you want to get to the end of pee and then you will get

678
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:21,151
And you can't get any further

679
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:24,223
Hey that was the

680
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:27,295
Theoretical bottom line for symbol codes

681
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:35,999
So the ideal code links information contents

682
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:42,399
He's like the probabilities we have to English base 2 of them

683
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:49,311
So in practice for any real probability distribution typically contacts

684
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:51,103
We got exactly to the entropy

685
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:58,527
So there's a missing result which is well how close can you get

686
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:02,111
And his fiance

687
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:08,255
And I'm not going to prove this put it in the textbook

688
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:17,471
If these ideal length l i * which all the time and information

689
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:21,055
Not integers

690
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:24,127
How close can you get

691
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:28,991
Answer well you can still always cat

692
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:34,367
Within one bit

693
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:37,695
Avanta p

694
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,231
So

695
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:41,535
There exists

696
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,583
Optimal single code

697
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:49,727
For which

698
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:53,311
Pacific

699
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,847
So I can get with it one bit

700
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:56,639
Which sounds pretty good

701
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:58,687
Come back next week

702
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:05,087
To hear whether this is good enough or whether in fact we still want to do better

703
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:19,167
So that's very what about practice wouldn't it be great to be able to just take a probability distribution

704
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:25,055
Optimal symbol code for that property distribution

705
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:27,359
Let me tell you how to do this

706
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:32,479
How to make optimal symbol codes

707
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:43,231
I'm looking to prove it you can read the book

708
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:52,191
The method for making multiple symbol codes cuz I will show you his cold the Huffman algorithm

709
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:54,495
Highness very elegant

710
00:51:55,007 --> 00:52:01,151
And it's not completely obvious why it should actually be off the mold and why it should get you any of the optimal

711
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:03,967
The ideal Shannon information count

712
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:05,503
Content

713
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:08,063
Codelynx

714
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:10,623
So is a summary of how it works

715
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:17,279
Remember how prefix code could be related to a binary tree is Bill that binary tree

716
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:23,423
Starting from the leaves we're going to start from the smallest most remote

717
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:27,519
Leaves build a binary tree

718
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:30,591
Stopping

719
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:33,151
From

720
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:38,527
Farthest

721
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,623
Leaves of the tree

722
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:46,975
And that's essentially the album let me show you what I mean

723
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:50,559
I'll see you with an example that's usually the easiest way

724
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:53,887
Let me

725
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:59,775
Invent a probability distribution

726
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:11,551
My cat hair is a 6 element probability event

727
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,135
And his

728
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:17,183
Statement of the algorithm

729
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:18,463
Combine

730
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:20,511
The

731
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:22,303
Two symbols

732
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:25,631
With smallest probability

733
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:34,591
Into a new single symbol

734
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:35,871
Android

735
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:37,151
Alabama

736
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:47,647
Okay so we look at our list of probabilities and we say these are the two smallest so we will combine them Define

737
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:53,023
A little bit of a binary tree we combine them 0.21

738
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:59,423
Inari repeat on the set of five

739
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:02,239
We got 0.2

740
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:03,007
Fife

741
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:10,175
Now we have to be foolproof smallest witch

742
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:13,247
14 + 521

743
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:14,783
Recombine them

744
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:18,111
We got zero point

745
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:19,391
3

746
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:21,183
5

747
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:23,999
I was the

748
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:28,351
First iteration of a second iteration of a Nation

749
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:30,399
And then

750
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:32,191
We've got

751
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:39,359
25 and 35 smaller than 40

752
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:43,455
So I can buy them at 0.6 in the fourth step

753
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:47,551
Then we can buy mace at 1

754
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:49,599
How about tonight

755
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:58,047
And now we've made a binary tree and so we have made prefix code because we can just slap label 0 1 0 1

756
00:54:58,303 --> 00:55:00,863
Anyway you like Vera Wang 01

757
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:02,143
Sarawak

758
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:06,751
And that defines a code words reading from the root back out

759
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:13,151
The leaves just as an example 100 to the code word you'll get to this one is

760
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:14,431
100

761
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:15,455
Unfeeling

762
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:16,223
Feliz

763
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:20,063
Optimal

764
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:22,367
Cool

765
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:23,647
Suck

766
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:25,695
Let me

767
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:28,255
Summarize what we've said

768
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:32,095
Reviews gets in equality

769
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:36,191
We talked about unique dakotabilities

770
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:39,007
We've introduced the idea of prefix codes

771
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:45,919
Binary trees and symbol codes that are really all about building nice binary trees

772
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:49,759
Whenever you get a code but does a TV entropy

773
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:54,623
The code links are equipped with information contents that's the ideal code length

774
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:59,743
And with a symbol code you can always get within one bit of entropy

775
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:02,815
And you can do that with the Huffman algorithm

776
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:07,423
Here are the results we stated without proof the book has

777
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:08,959
Proofs of photos

778
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:09,983
Results

779
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:17,151
I've got a few more slides just to keep things moving with some

780
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:23,551
Things you can be doing for next time I already encouraged you to do a project

781
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:29,951
Namely invent a compressor and on compressor resourceful 10000 prevent coin

782
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:31,743
Whose probability of warm is

783
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:38,143
.01 Implement and estimate how it works and the screen is God's mother

784
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:40,447
Recommended exercises and recommended

785
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:41,727
Reading

786
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:44,799
Thanks for coming see you next week

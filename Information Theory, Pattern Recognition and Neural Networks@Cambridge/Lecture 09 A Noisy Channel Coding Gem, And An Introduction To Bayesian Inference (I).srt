00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:12,544
Okay welcome to lecture number 9 today on main topic is going to be inference inference

2
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,128
Parameters for example you do a science experiment

3
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:18,432
And you want to infer the promises

4
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:19,968
Put on the LIE

5
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:22,016
Happy data you've got

6
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,320
But before we do that I want to

7
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:29,184
Point to a little gem of information Siri

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,232
You may not have noticed

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,072
I'd like us to start by thinking about

10
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:38,144
The binary Erasure Channel

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:44,544
What we did in the last couple of lectures was re-established Shannon's noisy Channel coding theorem that says

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,896
Any channel you can work out his capacity by maximizing Mutual information

13
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:55,296
And then it possible to make an encode and decode of it communicate reliably over.

14
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:56,064
Channel

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,744
Reliably meaning you can get the error probability as close as you like to zero but you can always communication anyway

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,536
Right up to the capacity

17
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:09,632
What's the capacity of the binary AirAsia

18
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,168
Channel please

19
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,960
Have a quick chat to your neighbor

20
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,008
Here's a question

21
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:18,336
And I'll go sold it over here in just one minute

22
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:28,064
So there's only two ways you can solve these questions

23
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,160
You can either work out the mutual information this way around

24
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,464
Or

25
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,768
People around

26
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,704
And often one way is easier than the other

27
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,032
So let's do this

28
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:51,360
Binary Erasure Channel both ways round

29
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,408
I'll generalize a little bit

30
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,456
So that we're putting in

31
00:01:55,968 --> 00:02:02,112
P0 and P1 because I'll pretend we don't know that the optimal optimal input distribution

32
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,648
Coolest have to be symmetric

33
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:09,280
And I'll call these probabilities

34
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:16,192
If we do it this way the first time is binary entropy of Tino's

35
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:22,848
And then the second time we need to think through all the different ways that could happen not quite a lot of what we need to think

36
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:23,872
Free things

37
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:28,480
Figure out how probable they are then look at what the entropy of x given Y is

38
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:33,856
That's quite a lot of work except almost all of it is easy if you got a zero you know that

39
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,904
Input was a zero so

40
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,464
There's no entry in that case

41
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,280
Simulate if apple is a Wong

42
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:48,192
Send input doesn't have any entropy anymore it's only if the? Comes out which happens with Provera

43
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,008
By hooker by crook

44
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:56,896
Then you still don't know what the input was any information at all about football

45
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:59,712
Posterior distribution of Empire is still

46
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:01,504
The same as it was when we started

47
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,088
So

48
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,392
Which is

49
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,440
Take 15 off

50
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,232
-1 -

51
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:14,816
Maximize that with respect to Pinos

52
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,120
You end up with Pinot equals 1/2

53
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:19,424
If you want X

54
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,288
Okay

55
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:30,688
So usually doing it this way around is a bit hard cuz you have to think about lots of

56
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:36,064
Inferences but in this case those three inferences were fairly easy so this was a nice route

57
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,344
For solving this

58
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:44,768
Open early we could have worked out the entropy of why that means you need to work out the identity of the probability

59
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,560
Why

60
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:51,936
Being zero why being?

61
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,984
And why she ain't

62
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,568
One and you could lavoris a workout those three

63
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,152
Numbers the probability of getting a 0 out

64
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,432
Is

65
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:07,808
0 *

66
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,856
One nice ass

67
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:16,512
Etc so you could work out those three numbers then you have a big massive stuff to put into the entropy company

68
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:21,119
3 *

69
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,423
So that looks like a turbo to work

70
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:26,495
Then secondly we want the ad field why

71
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,775
Given X

72
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:31,871
That's easier because if you condition on a particular

73
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,407
X coming in

74
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:39,807
Then the entry why is was just a choice between 0 or?? And the entropy of that distribution

75
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:46,207
Is the same either way around it's just H2O that was an easy thing this is looking horrendous but I want

76
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,487
To introduce you

77
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:53,887
To a little of property of entropy which recover decomposability

78
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:00,799
This is not virgin sorry we're getting to the gym in a moment

79
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,615
I think a possibility

80
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:08,479
You can if you want work out the entropy of a distribution over several

81
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,271
Characters in alphabet

82
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,575
Fight

83
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:18,975
Imagining that you learned the character in a sequence of steps and add up how much xp you get on average at 8

84
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,999
Each of those steps

85
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,815
You could imagine finding out

86
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:23,839
Is

87
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:26,655
The character that came out a? Or not

88
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,191
I'm Reno

89
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:31,519
That the fraction of question marks coming out is always f

90
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,823
Doesn't matter what input distribution you vote for

91
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,151
We can say first

92
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,199
What's the?

93
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,223
And then

94
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,271
If not

95
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,807
What was it

96
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:46,879
And

97
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,183
Then and fee of Y

98
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:54,559
Is the sum of the amount event for you guys to teach with her stepfather first you got the entropy

99
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,607
Ask

100
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:59,167
Stefania is a? Or something else

101
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,727
Then

102
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:06,079
With probability 1 - at it's something else

103
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,383
And then you got the entropy

104
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:13,759
Of finding out whether it's a zero or one given that you know that it's not a?

105
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:18,367
The probability of 0 or 1 if you know it's not a? That's coming out

106
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:21,183
Is just the same as Pinot who he wants the same

107
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:24,511
Bryce Sheffer to the entry of that is

108
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,559
H-2a peanut

109
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,399
Okay sorry that

110
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:33,727
In the textbook as well if you want to read up on

111
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,519
Clarify what I just told you

112
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:40,639
You can make life easy for yourself by being smart about high computer interface

113
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:44,223
So this was looking hairy but it's not too hairy when we did it that way

114
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:49,087
Answer the answer comes out to be useful information is equal to

115
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,135
This wall switch is HVAC

116
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:54,207
Prefer

117
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,999
+ 1 - at

118
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,559
Translate Filipino

119
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,143
Minus this thing which is a true that

120
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:05,727
We have a grand cancellation of H20

121
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:11,103
I molested by myself h2p note as we had before when you maximize at the capacity

122
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:14,943
Is

123
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,223
Who am I

124
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:24,159
What time does the capacity I want to go back to this diagram everything we talked about

125
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:28,255
Annoy Channel coding said let them out then we go to noisy Channel

126
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:31,583
I'm going to slap a clever and coder on the front

127
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:36,191
Looking to add a clip of Dakota that does inference during the input balls

128
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:41,823
How fast can we communicate

129
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:45,919
For this particular channel the answer is you can communicate at a rate

130
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:52,063
One- at Paris

131
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,855
That's achievable

132
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,159
Nah

133
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:01,535
Imagine that we had introduced a completely different topic

134
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,559
Cooled

135
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:09,471
Noisy Channel coding with feedback so I'm going to change Instagram now I'm going to mention the completely different diagram

136
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:12,031
Where everything that comes out of the channel

137
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,823
Get back

138
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,359
And is available

139
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,175
To the encoder

140
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,223
Why are the different diagram

141
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:23,039
He's got an extra communication link

142
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:27,647
Back from the end of the channel to the encoder exactly what's going on

143
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,695
So if the encoder

144
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,719
Send

145
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:35,327
For example 10010

146
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,423
And what comes after the channel Mike

147
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,191
Happy

148
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,727
?

149
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,519
There's a rug?

150
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,287
Is there a

151
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,079
11?

152
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,407
No

153
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:56,319
What's the answer to the question how fast can you communicate over this channel given that you've got feedback available

154
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:58,111
Am I completely change the game right

155
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:05,023
Because the sort of encoding trait you could not use is you could just say while I'm going to listen to my output

156
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,303
?

157
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,863
I will retransmit it was just lost

158
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,167
Cuz I know that I didn't receive anything

159
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,215
So I'll just Ricans match

160
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,239
So you wouldn't

161
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,263
Use

162
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,055
First story

163
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:22,431
If you had the? You're trying to send one

164
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,479
What you would send would be

165
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,551
So

166
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,831
This is original

167
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,111
Sure

168
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,439
And then your transmission

169
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:39,839
Would be assuming that a question mark happened at the fourth

170
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,703
What were you trying to make

171
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,983
You would transmit

172
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:52,639
100 again because?

173
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,663
And then

174
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:58,015
Okay I think that the next one is a Wong

175
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,295
So that gets

176
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,599
Lost is not a?

177
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,647
Insight transmit again

178
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,231
Satan would just clear the manager at on the bus

179
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,535
Okay you keep on

180
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:13,375
Transmission symbol until it is correctly received

181
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:20,031
What's the rate you're going to be able to achieve with that clever scheme is making use of this feedback

182
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,079
Habitats your neighbor

183
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,967
Anyone

184
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,783
What rate can you communicate.

185
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,087
If you ain't used to the red tape I think

186
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,391
On average

187
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,839
So

188
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:51,519
If you just imagine how much of the time you spend successfully communicating it's whenever the wrong? You have

189
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,287
Channel

190
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,823
That was a?

191
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:54,847
Coming out

192
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,407
You want a cheap and reliable communication atoll

193
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,735
And the fraction of time?

194
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:06,111
So the rate at which all communicating using the steam link is

195
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,743
Any questions anyone

196
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,535
Not clear on this

197
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,655
Yes so

198
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:25,823
When are the possible question marks in a row you just keep on retransmitting until what comes after the channel is nothing

199
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,591
?

200
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,663
Retransmitting

201
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:34,527
Doesn't affect this argument the argument is if this is time

202
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,319
But if you send

203
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,879
Symbols on the some of them

204
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,671
Got time to the question marks

205
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:48,095
Then you're going to be successful in communicating in all of these

206
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,191
Vincent's hair

207
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,519
Whether or not?

208
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:01,663
Every time does not a? You will have thought the next bit across

209
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,455
Does not relevant

210
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:09,855
Whether the? Cluster together every time there is any? The next bit will humping

211
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,623
Next one in the file

212
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,415
All right

213
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:18,815
When you see back you all communication on averages race 1 -

214
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,119
Woman's that Bit Spur

215
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,655
Units of time

216
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,191
Use of the channel

217
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,263
Oh my goodness that's the time

218
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:35,967
So we added feedback which made life much easier for us but it hasn't actually increase the rate at which we can

219
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:39,807
Communicate

220
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,623
And Shawna is saying

221
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:49,279
Should we redo all of information Theory to include feedback I'm answer is no

222
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:55,935
You don't need feedback just use around them code just use a really small writing to make an appropriate

223
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:59,775
Dakota and you don't need to buy feedback doesn't actually help you communicate

224
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,799
Antipasto

225
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,591
So that's a gym for me

226
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:11,295
And there are araiza correcting codeschool Fountain codes

227
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,087
Cuz a lot of you to communicate

228
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:17,183
Almost at the capacity of Arabia channels and finding codes are

229
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,975
In chapter 50 of

230
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:19,999
The textbook

231
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,559
Any questions

232
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:35,359
Okay question is what if you had errors in the feedback Channel sometimes

233
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,639
Then what would you do

234
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:43,039
Enchanted looks like I'm not going to use a feedback anyway cuz he's not helping so it could make things with us if

235
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,343
You trusted the feedback and it wasn't trustworthy

236
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,623
We don't need it

237
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,951
Okay

238
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,767
On Riverside

239
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,839
Let's not talk about inference

240
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,375
And I'm going to

241
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:59,423
In this lecture look at

242
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,959
A very simple

243
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,751
Inference problem

244
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:05,823
People often work with gasoline distribution

245
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:12,223
We'll look at the gasoline distribution for this lecture but I will rapidly moves on to other morning

246
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,015
Distribution

247
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,807
For gas station

248
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:21,439
It doesn't really change your life to say I now I'm going to learn how to do in France right because

249
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:24,767
The extended methods of dealing with thousands are already fine

250
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,071
But I'm going to talk to you

251
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:33,215
In the next lecture but when you look at other problems apart from inferring the mean and standard deviation of the Galaxy

252
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:39,103
It can transform your life when you learn how to actually do things right instead of using ad hoc Curry's

253
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,943
Stop

254
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,271
The general topic were discussing now

255
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,575
Is inference

256
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:52,415
Amazon motivations you might have for doing inference

257
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:55,231
Maybe we'll doing

258
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,023
Cosmology

259
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:02,399
Android unknown cosmological parameters used some nice big expensive

260
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,935
Telescopes and

261
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,471
Stop lights and things

262
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:10,591
And those underlying political private has like Hubble constant in the matzav

263
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:16,991
Dark matter in this month give rise to Cosmic microwave background radiation fluctuations

264
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:22,111
And you measure those measurements

265
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:25,439
Open imperfect noisy measurements

266
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:29,535
I may be upset stupid IV as well

267
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:36,703
Oops I should have gone half that cools by the same as long as a new measure

268
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,031
Properties of a supernova

269
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:43,103
And then having made over those measurements

270
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:49,759
We want to infer okay what do we believe about

271
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:53,087
Infer

272
00:15:56,415 --> 00:16:00,511
Is another motivation maybe you still use email

273
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:05,887
And when you receive emails is email wrong email to insightful

274
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:12,031
There is an underlying variable that you might care about which is actually a piece of spam or not

275
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:17,407
This is a variable cold-weather this particular item is spam

276
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:21,759
9022 email

277
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,807
And to save your time

278
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:28,159
How to save the OS infinite amounts of time

279
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:32,255
Delete this time yourself you'd like to have an automated method of just looking at the email

280
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,535
And inferring

281
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,351
This spam variable

282
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,519
So you might want to spam filter

283
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,591
What's the matter examples

284
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,895
We might be wanting to do

285
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,431
Image recognition

286
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,223
Speech recognition

287
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,271
Character recognition

288
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,207
Image Direct

289
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,743
Speech Rec

290
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,119
Character

291
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,191
Recognition printed or handwritten

292
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,471
Characters

293
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,567
On the general pattern is

294
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:21,407
Does something on the left hand side which is the underlying

295
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:27,807
Message I think we care about and what comes out on the right is sensitive data that depends on that we want to turn the air around

296
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,343
And then further thing

297
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:32,415
On the left hand side on the line cordless

298
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,743
Okay

299
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,815
Just getting back to spawn example

300
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:42,655
DeSoto way you might imagine handling spam

301
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,447
As you might imagine

302
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:51,359
Females living in a Face-Off email and real emails to you that you do want to read

303
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,663
My thoughts before Linda cluster

304
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,943
Emails about

305
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,247
Wind power emails about

306
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,063
Bayesian inference

307
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:07,487
Emails about spam clusters

308
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:10,047
And I need to golf spam about

309
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:15,167
Russian lessons nigerians and insightful

310
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:18,239
Different colors of pills

311
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,775
And we want to

312
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,823
Infer

313
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,615
These clusters and

314
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,943
Reliably identify

315
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:29,503
The stuff in the Clusters that we do care about

316
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:33,855
So you think of spam as maybe being clustering problem and string

317
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,671
I'm next time all the time after

318
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:42,815
Kevin Hogan

319
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,655
And given how prevalent

320
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,983
Videos of dancing distributions is

321
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:53,055
Let's chat a little bit of a problem

322
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:57,663
Where what going on is that the mean and the standard deviation

323
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,711
An outcrop some data

324
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,247
X1

325
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,039
Through

326
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:05,087
At 10

327
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,415
My notation that I'll try and use consistently

328
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:11,999
Is in general ends going to be the amount of data we get

329
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:18,399
Little and is always going to run from warm to end whenever you see a suffix you can usually info it goes up to

330
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,423
Without me saying

331
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,495
Also animals and try to use the same

332
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,263
Latha

333
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,543
Fairly consistently

334
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,103
All right

335
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:33,503
And this is a gaussian distribution started to be completely explicit P of X and given you an Sigma

336
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:38,623
1 / square root of 2

337
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:41,951
8 - x - news

338
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,999
Scrap OVA

339
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,815
Two Sigma squared

340
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,119
Hummus

341
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:55,007
And the test is we want to infer and sigma

342
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,799
Kevin

343
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,847
Are they tough

344
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,895
Right

345
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,455
Let's do that

346
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,767
So let's walk through

347
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:19,327
The world looking in

348
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:25,215
And it's good to always distinguish Two Worlds one is hypoxia space where parameters live

349
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:32,127
And another is the weather Wednesday to lift and in this case confusingly they both look kind of similar to each other

350
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:38,015
Because the unknown mean could be anywhere on the real line and the day to come on the real line

351
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:38,783
But

352
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:45,183
I'll try to keep track of when we talk about a date axis label acts and when are we talkin about

353
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:48,511
A hypothesis actress that might be labeled mute

354
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:55,679
All of the data points come along the stage right

355
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,447
Stigma

356
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:59,775
I mentioned to her as well the one way of telling the difference

357
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:06,175
Is sometimes will show of you I just found the cigarettes at 62 dimensions

358
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:10,783
Is a one-dimensional picture and it shows

359
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:16,159
Poor 6 possible different settings of Mew and sigma

360
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:22,560
All of which happen to have the same but he was Sigma the prediction about the data would be so Visa

361
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,096
Send it down c&n citiz

362
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,376
But different values

363
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,912
Of Mew and sigma

364
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,704
Diesel half and half

365
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:30,240
Different

366
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:33,056
And the same better Sigma named Eliza Griswold

367
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,616
Okay next

368
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:41,504
Here are another six possible hypotheses about

369
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,528
Where

370
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,832
The news all happen to be the same

371
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:47,648
On the standard deviations vary from .5

372
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,672
Up to

373
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:53,536
So what did I do that I just stumbled around in the hypothesis space

374
00:21:54,048 --> 00:22:00,192
And showed you one two three four five six points in this two-dimensional space here

375
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:03,008
Maybe I'll quickly get rid of Vegas Facebook

376
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:06,592
So I showed you six

377
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:07,616
9

378
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,920
6 hypotheses

379
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:17,088
Like this in data space

380
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:22,720
What each of those products or any particular one of these makes its own production in the database

381
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,744
Which looks

382
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:29,120
Besides that's what I'd expect today to be like if I am true

383
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:33,216
Okay here are

384
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:38,592
Another different from each other

385
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,432
And you and sigma slice each one of them are shown it

386
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,200
Predictions

387
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,224
And

388
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,504
Thai Spice

389
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,552
Okay

390
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,136
How to do inference

391
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,440
Mew and sigma

392
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:57,024
This is the correct way to do inference you get your data

393
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,072
Hey I'm telling you want to go 5

394
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,352
Datapoints

395
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:02,400
Which will arrive at these horizontal

396
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:04,192
Coordinates Hannah I just slept

397
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,216
Above

398
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,008
The line

399
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,824
Coventry Y coordinates

400
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,384
Right

401
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,944
What does Bayes theorem say you should do

402
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:17,504
Well you should update

403
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,296
Your beliefs

404
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:24,672
About me at Sigma in proportion to how well each of those bodies of Mew and sigma

405
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,720
Predicted

406
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:39,776
FaceTime says how provolone

407
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,592
Is

408
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:45,152
How well they predicting today Utah

409
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:49,760
X how profitable

410
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,296
Before you.

411
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:54,368
Normalize

412
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:00,768
Mets normalizing constant is

413
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,584
Integral

414
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,656
Simi

415
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,704
Two Sigma

416
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,752
Hope to stop sex

417
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,016
No

418
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:24,832
I'm taking

419
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:30,976
For the next few lectures quite a Hardline position that I think when does a well posed question does the correct answer to it

420
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:35,584
And this is in contrast to the way I love people think about statistical inference

421
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:41,984
Does another way of doing inference why there's lots of ways of answering those questions and I think that's extraordinary

422
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,776
Thing to believe I think there is

423
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:46,336
A correct way of answering Lopez problems

424
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:49,664
I don't think infants should be an exception from it

425
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:53,248
Something to make real explicit is that

426
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:57,088
Only difference is depend on the assumptions

427
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:04,256
Some people sometimes you don't have to make assumptions

428
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,424
But how could it be otherwise

429
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,496
So every one of these things is conditioned on H

430
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:25,248
HSV assumption that the data come from a gaussian distribution and it's whatever

431
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:28,576
If you want to make about what we believe me to take my might be

432
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,600
Beforehand

433
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:32,928
And I think it's on the schedule that you do have to make a

434
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,952
Photos options

435
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,000
All right

436
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,072
What does it actually look like

437
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:43,680
Well this is saying how well did you predict the date this is the

438
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,704
The meat of it

439
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,520
Y'all sleep if we haven't got any particular

440
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:52,896
Strong interesting prior knowledge about me to take my dependent

441
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,200
On-base arm says

442
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:59,808
You don't need to know how well they were predicting things that didn't happen

443
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:05,440
Tile probabilities on not relevant is no such thing as tails in the correct way of doing in Prince

444
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:08,512
All you need to do is look at the values

445
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:09,792
Oh

446
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:16,448
The predictive densities the 5-day two values that have actually occurred so if we wanted to compare

447
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:22,848
Just the six hypotheses that I've identified on the screen the rainbow

448
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:28,224
Six different colors the only numbers you need to know to answer that question

449
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:34,624
The number is highlighted by the point at which the probability density assigned to the

450
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,160
Six different hypotheses

451
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:38,976
Of course the full-face hypotheses is

452
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:42,560
The Infinite Space the whole book value

453
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:47,168
But if we just wanted to keep a V6 that's what you need to know

454
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:51,008
What you do with them while you want to come out and you multiply them together because

455
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:55,360
The probability if you're coming independently

456
00:26:55,616 --> 00:27:00,480
This is just a product from 1 to end

457
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:05,344
All vaccines given mean and sigma

458
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,880
Which we already wrote down

459
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:10,720
Overhead door just need to multiply two numbers together

460
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:14,816
And that gives us a lot to his riches how well you predicted

461
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,096
What happened

462
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,144
Okay

463
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:22,496
So those numbers are always relevant to the inference

464
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,616
So what does that look like what does one of those numbers look like

465
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:28,896
I'm going to

466
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:31,712
Reduce the size of a Titus at down from 5

467
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,992
To just warm

468
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:40,160
And now I'm going to wonder around the hypothesis-based muessigmann looking at what happens

469
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:40,928
2

470
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:43,488
The value of P of x n

471
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:47,328
Given to you and sigma as we wander around and you and signifies

472
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,608
This is what it looks like

473
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:52,448
So I'm going to slide across at Six Sigma

474
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,752
And then different values of Six Sigma

475
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,800
Total for his example

476
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:59,360
Here's a value of Mew and sigma

477
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:04,480
And a grown little spiked hair whose length is the same as the height

478
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,248
From

479
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:07,808
The y-axis to the yellow Cafe

480
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:08,832
All right

481
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,440
I'm going to wander around adding spikes

482
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:19,840
I'm hopefully you can see the eclipse in lines that show

483
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:26,240
How high is the orange star wars about the y-axis for each of those possible values of

484
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:32,896
And it's not very surprising that what that looks like is it going to be in with the same width as the standard deviation we just picked

485
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:37,248
1.2 as I told all three of those Levi's let's switch to another body or Sigma

486
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:42,368
It's the small things

487
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:44,160
Shutting how well

488
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:50,560
Today's predicted the same day tomorrow

489
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,864
Repeat Sargon even firespike

490
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,144
Adam purple

491
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:00,544
We can make a surface plot

492
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,080
I want some of those look like

493
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,872
And here they are

494
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:09,248
Any particular value Sigma it looks like a bump that goes up and down

495
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:12,320
As you come to smaller and smaller values

496
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:15,136
The high for that guy seems getting higher and higher

497
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:19,488
So the console port is actually a slightly scary looking thing there

498
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,584
Sofra Singleton

499
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,120
Stupid my wifey

500
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,200
Acanto fluff

501
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,272
Has consoles

502
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:50,208
It look something like that with these two hypotheses

503
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,584
Tan have extremely small Weiser signal that just happened to nail the

504
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,608
Really precisely

505
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,400
So that's the likelihood function

506
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:01,728
In the case of 1 datapoint showing how well

507
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,776
Every purple Valley from U and sigma

508
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:04,800
Predicted

509
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,336
Hot what happened

510
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:07,872
Okay

511
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:16,064
Let's repeat that and I will multiply together five of those things are going to look at the product of five of these functions if you

512
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,928
How's your wonder and immune Sigma space and it's for these fine face points

513
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,232
When you take

514
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:25,536
The five numbers showing there

515
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,840
And multiply them all together

516
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:31,936
The product is this little orange stick shown on the right hand side

517
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:39,872
Very small number phone number

518
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,152
Lance Morgan

519
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:46,528
Change Sigma to a small value

520
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:48,320
And it went up and came down

521
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:54,208
And pick up my multiplying lcdc please scan the Crossville multiplying things with our galaxy and functions

522
00:30:54,464 --> 00:31:00,608
With each other either the galaxy of the scented on different values the product of a rose is still a gaussian integer

523
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:03,168
Replacing at

524
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:08,288
And that woman has to be higher this one with Sigma as we went across to look at

525
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:10,336
Values of singer equals no .6

526
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:12,128
We got a high peak

527
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:14,176
95 signal point five

528
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:17,248
Purple we find out we can even hire a peek

529
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:19,552
And I forgot to an even small about your semen

530
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,600
Roughly a quarter

531
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:24,928
Not when you multiply together these five

532
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,464
Purple numbers

533
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,536
Some of them are quite close to zero

534
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:34,144
And so we're not doing quite so well anymore so I made the Redskin that

535
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,680
Iris pahatsi

536
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:38,496
Redskin the highest 8.2 isn't as high as

537
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,288
Mr. purple

538
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,568
Okay

539
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,616
Suck what has happened

540
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:48,992
Now if we do a contour plot of the products

541
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:52,064
This was for just one like

542
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:58,464
How to make a Funko Pop

543
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,560
Steven Yeun

544
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,096
It looks like this

545
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,376
It looks

546
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:11,008
A bit like that

547
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:16,128
Oodles and it doesn't have a scary bizarre place where are Infinities happen

548
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:17,408
Tyme hair anymore

549
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:19,712
All right

550
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:26,112
And we can ask the question what is the best type of this in the sense of the highest

551
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,392
Likelihood

552
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,208
So this point

553
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:35,072
Nothing's got any special status at all this is not an essential thing to

554
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:40,704
The focus song but people sometimes

555
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:46,080
You can go find the menu and the sigma

556
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:49,152
When does a simple homework exercise to work out the formula

557
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,432
So that if you want

558
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,224
And

559
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:58,624
The night seemed like no promises Usher and after the stages at the green line

560
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,464
Density looks like when you sent me when signature

561
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:03,744
Right

562
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,512
So

563
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:07,840
Want to go to like a good you can if you want to go and find

564
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:11,680
The promises that have the biggest value of the function

565
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:13,984
Positive that's not

566
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:19,616
Fundamental the fundamental thing you want to do when you're doing inference is you want to know the whole Buster distribution

567
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,152
Not just

568
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:24,480
Professional music music system

569
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:28,576
All right so that's the maximum like it promise

570
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:34,208
Going back to the entire like a function this is what it looks like when we spin it round

571
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:38,560
South China on the bottom

572
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,096
Uppababy

573
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,400
A log scale surface

574
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:44,960
Right

575
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:52,128
So if you do the homework exercise and you work out what the maximum likelihood value of

576
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,664
Mu and sigma is

577
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:57,248
You may not be surprised to find that

578
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:59,808
Mew maximum likelihood

579
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:01,088
Is

580
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,880
Xbox

581
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:05,440
Hannity does you slide across to any

582
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:07,232
Possible values Sigma

583
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,512
The maximum

584
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:13,632
Value of the likelihood there any slicing volume Sigma is

585
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:16,192
Xbox being by definition

586
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:18,240
Iran

587
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:20,800
Xn

588
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:27,968
I'm not something you can derive wouldn't have to guess let's think of an estimate from you you just write down the light YouTube

589
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:30,016
Function is a simple homework exercise

590
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,040
Define

591
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:37,440
The maximum of that function is at this location in contrast the standard statistics when think that

592
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:43,840
Difficult and you need to make S Tomatoes you end up scratching

593
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:46,144
Hair the likely function

594
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:50,496
Is a way of coming out with estimate is if you want to point a point value

595
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,080
What about Sigma well

596
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:59,456
The maximum likelihood value Sigma is what you get when you press the stigma and button on your calculator

597
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,016
So

598
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:08,672
Your calculator has two Sigma buttons you shoved in the day turn to a live load calculator

599
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:11,744
10 - 1 button in the maximum likelihood

600
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:15,840
Is what you get when you press Sigma

601
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:20,960
No

602
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:27,872
Discount applied hair isn't so the symmetric it it doesn't have concentric circles that that's what

603
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,920
Lopsided getting wider as you go up

604
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:32,480
And the reason for that is fairly intuitive

605
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:37,088
If it were actually the case that the me

606
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:39,136
Is not equal to

607
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,160
Did Asa mean

608
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:45,280
It will be okay something you the true underlying mean isn't exactly the station mean

609
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:47,584
For example the true value is

610
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:50,400
Hey a little bit away

611
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,168
From

612
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,704
Potato mean

613
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:53,984
Then

614
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,008
Think of

615
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:58,336
What the battery probably is given that

616
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:00,896
All the lights are off of the coast around here Bass

617
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:06,528
The average distance the mean Square distance to one of those

618
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:08,576
Because we moved away from the day to me

619
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:10,880
Then it was when we were out today to me

620
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:13,952
That means our estimate of how big do there is probably is

621
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:20,352
Is a bit bigger than what you would think the variances if you knew that the true mean really is equal to the day

622
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:21,120
Say to me

623
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,656
So that's why

624
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,704
Peak Vista

625
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,240
Why did function hat

626
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:30,080
Is off that little bit upwards away from the value house

627
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:33,664
If we assume you is actually both of the day to me

628
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:36,480
Sidedness

629
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:40,832
And if we take into account now the fact that we don't know

630
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,112
New

631
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:46,976
And if someone told I don't care. I want to know how big the noise

632
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:49,024
Level is because I'm interested in noise

633
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:52,608
Please tell me what I should believe about the noise give Anastasia

634
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:56,960
And given that we haven't got a clue what we do is accept what they show is telling us

635
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:02,336
If we now put that request into mathematics

636
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,384
What the requester is telling us

637
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,200
I'm going to clear about what Miu is and I don't care

638
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:10,784
They saying I've got a very broad prior on me

639
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,648
Okay let's just use an unspecified

640
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:21,280
Uniform distribution of some with that we don't care anymore

641
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:27,424
And then it saying please tell me what I should believe about Sigma

642
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:29,728
The way you answer that question

643
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,264
Is

644
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,080
We can work out

645
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:39,200
We could imagine receding into steps we could say

646
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:45,344
What would you be she doesn't want to know me but let's imagine inferi it anyway

647
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:49,440
Let's imagine when you Sigma Delta Zeta

648
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,560
How advanced insurance work

649
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:59,680
Well we need to know the date I given U and sigma

650
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:02,240
X the prior probability

651
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:04,032
Have you

652
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:10,432
Normalize by the productivity

653
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,224
Sorry

654
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:19,136
Talk to myself a self inference number 1

655
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:24,256
Where where we imagine answering the thing that we don't care about

656
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:32,960
So you need to pry which I said is going to be some rules distribution one of a Delta Museum

657
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,544
Secondary Brule disrespect

658
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,552
And then this probability is the likelihood function

659
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,368
But we're assuming that we no Stigma

660
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,696
What does normalizing constant while this is

661
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:56,000
The integral theme

662
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:58,048
Kayavax

663
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,840
70

664
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,120
X

665
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,960
Normalizing constant

666
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:12,128
Often we ignore no more than constant speakers are they just know there's no dependents

667
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,944
All the thing on the left hand side

668
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:16,480
A little magic constant

669
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:22,880
But around the beautiful pass and often occurs in a serving for the normalizing constant one person doesn't care

670
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:25,440
90 + anybody wants to know

671
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:30,816
Is exactly the answer to the question someone else wants to know inference number two

672
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:32,352
Inference number two

673
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:35,424
The first player casters for

674
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,264
Was he said I just want to know what I should believe about Sigma

675
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,544
Given the data

676
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,104
And if you decide to come to my house

677
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,128
Cast

678
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:51,808
I'm not 580sm is the purpose of people today to give him Sigma sign for probably

679
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:57,184
/ normalizing he doesn't care

680
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:04,608
The date of dependent time but he does care about is the probability of all the data

681
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:05,632
Kevin Sigma

682
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,912
And that is

683
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,960
Personalizing constant

684
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:15,616
That is a very common pattern that when you just follow the rules of probability to work out what you want to know

685
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,408
Normalizing constants

686
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:23,808
That one person or unimportant for the next level of inference

687
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,416
So hey we need to do an integral with respect in view of this likelihood function

688
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:30,208
Assuming a flat

689
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:31,232
Prana hat

690
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:33,280
That's a simple homework exercise

691
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:35,328
When you do that inference

692
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,120
You can work out

693
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,144
What

694
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,424
The likelihood

695
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:43,008
Study of data

696
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:48,128
Given Sigma is as a function of Sigma so I'm going to show you my little grass

697
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,432
The likelihood

698
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:54,016
As a function of stigma and what it looks like is

699
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:56,832
That sort of thing

700
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:04,000
Is that the garbage day for the gamma distribution and it's going to Pink

701
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:06,048
And the peak is at

702
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:08,608
Sigma - 1

703
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:13,728
So that's what you think is for on the couch like that in this

704
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:15,520
Probability

705
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:19,616
View of inferences probability-based or Bayesian View

706
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,920
Okay

707
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:27,552
So what I've done here is I

708
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:33,952
Reintroduce you to familiar things that you've known since you were 15 years old you've had a calculator

709
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:37,280
Annex Barber I have a cigarette in Boston

710
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,328
How to say more n -1 button

711
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:44,960
And now we know a meaning for these buttons that they always of finding peaks of various

712
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:47,776
Likelihood functions of model likelihood

713
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:54,175
This thing we do here so the likelihood function is the likelihood all new and

714
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:54,943
Sigma

715
00:41:57,247 --> 00:42:00,575
This is the correct use of the word likelihood by the way

716
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:02,367
The likelihood is

717
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:08,511
Imma talk about the probability of some data conditioned on the thing that we call it the likelihood of

718
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:14,911
Many people sadly used would like it improbability interchangeably

719
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:19,519
What is the likelihood of this is a probability of that and that Exchange.

720
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:26,175
When doing statistics I think it's a good idea to be absolutely rigorous about these are the times we use

721
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:32,575
Only when it's that correct usage which is in this context

722
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:37,695
This thing here is emotional like to hit

723
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:41,023
It's the motto of likelihood

724
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:45,631
Call Sigma

725
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:48,447
Which means it's the probability of all the data

726
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,983
Kevin Sigler

727
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:52,543
This thing way down here

728
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,383
Is the mountain like the hood

729
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:59,967
Alpha hypothesis

730
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:03,807
Which is the hypothesis that says

731
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:05,599
What did Isaac came from

732
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:08,415
I think I've seen with me and you and

733
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:10,975
IMDb action Sigma with

734
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:13,279
Prior distribution is described by P of Maryland

735
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:14,303
Sigma

736
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:20,703
There is another name that is sometimes given to this thing because it's such an important quality

737
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:23,007
I'm not going to like it is a bit of a mouthful

738
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:28,127
And sounds may be too technical perception important to take

739
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:30,943
I was going to see in the next election

740
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:37,599
This is the important if you want to do model comparison if you have if you had an alternative theory for weather station came from

741
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:40,415
This is how well this quantity measures

742
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:44,255
How well the theory age predicted the date of the happened

743
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:50,655
So this is what we need in order to model comparison

744
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:51,679
The evidence

745
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:56,031
4 model X that's not a universal

746
00:43:56,543 --> 00:44:01,919
Notation of universal name but like a lot of people use this name as an alternative

747
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:03,967
Name for module likelihood

748
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,271
Okay

749
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:07,551
So that was

750
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:11,391
A familiar Beast dancing distribution

751
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:13,439
Answering the question

752
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:15,999
When you use Bayesian inference

753
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,303
What what

754
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:29,055
I got a question was is the evidence of Prior on the prior address I didn't eat in the next election we're going to do it

755
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:30,079
Mobile comparison

756
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:36,223
And what the evidence is is how well the theory

757
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:37,247
Predicted

758
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,783
The date of the happened

759
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:45,951
You when you want to do inferences how probable this theory is compared with other theories you need to put your own prior

760
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:50,815
On those those hypotheses the prior probability of hypothesis is not

761
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:57,727
All right just as here this is a likelihood

762
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,007
How much is the price

763
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:02,079
So the role that we haven't played in model comparison

764
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:05,151
Is the role that the body that the likelihood is playing

765
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:07,455
Endless Runner face there

766
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:09,247
So

767
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:11,807
Will do it again in the next election hopefully he'll become

768
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:12,575
Clara

769
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:18,463
In the next election we're going to start off with the following exercise

770
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:24,863
This is an exercise that I took from the exam paper in the Cambridge physics

771
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:25,887
Past exams

772
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:28,191
From the 1980s also

773
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:30,239
I'm the same question sad

774
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:36,895
Imagine that a source is emitting particles and IDK locations which we measure those location

775
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:43,295
Exponentially distributed in the length Skylander missile picture shows what that might look like if your

776
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:45,855
It was axes the horizontal coordinates

777
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:49,439
And the y-coordinate is just

778
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:51,743
Spacing points away from each other

779
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:58,655
The taser can only be observed however if location Fulton the window in the window goes from X-Men X-Men

780
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:00,447
1

781
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,983
220 centimeters

782
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:08,127
Now and decays are observed and their locations Xbox Rex and what do you think Lambda is

783
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:13,247
That's exam question and I want you to think about that for the next lecture

784
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:17,599
And I'd like you especially to cast your mind back

785
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:21,951
Before you ever heard of bass them as being the right way to do in Prince

786
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:25,279
How would you have solved this problem

787
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:27,327
Before you knew about base 10

788
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:32,191
And I'm hoping that you'll find it interesting to see how easy it is to solve this problem

789
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:36,287
Replaced them and how this contrasts with

790
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:40,383
Perhaps the difficulty of solving this problem

791
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:43,455
With all the ways you might have come across beforehand

792
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:48,575
So that's what we'll do next time

793
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:51,391
Thank you very much for listening just as a question

794
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:00,863
Yes absolutely so the question is

795
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:09,567
In the statistics literature and standard textbooks people talk about number of degrees of freedom

796
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:12,895
When you go from Aunt and might as well and you've lost one degree of freedom

797
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:18,015
And that absolutely is a helpful way to think about these things what we've done when we did this

798
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:24,415
Integral hair which we didn't actually do I said do that integral as I will question you integrated

799
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,695
That one parameter

800
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:31,583
Anat Goebbels up one degree of freedom of the noise if you actually knew

801
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,631
Un datapoints

802
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:36,959
Then you would have an independent measurements of how big the variances

803
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:38,495
But

804
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:42,847
If we don't know Mew and we integrated that we've lost one of those

805
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:45,919
Degrees of freedom if you like

806
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:50,783
Of measurement of noise so the number is that the number of independent measurements because of the noise

807
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:55,135
Has been reduced to a 10-1 it's definitely a helpful way to think about these things

808
00:47:56,671 --> 00:48:01,535
It's all so you don't need to understand that concept to get the right answer

809
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:04,863
If you just write down the likelihood do the integral

810
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:05,887
Closest Ralph's

811
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:08,703
And say I'm interested in knowing which type of this

812
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:13,567
Did the best job of putting the day that you will find Sigma and -1 and you don't even need to understand

813
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:14,591
Degrees of freedom

814
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:19,455
But definitely degrees of freedom is an interesting and useful concept

815
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:21,247
Questions

816
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,319
Okay thank you

1
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,424
Last time

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,960
We discussed

3
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:10,752
Inference

4
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:14,848
And information measures for a pair of Random

5
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:17,152
Fables is pear pendant

6
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:20,736
Random variables let me just recap

7
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:22,528
Those two topics

8
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:24,320
Fairly quickly

9
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:25,344
Inference

10
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:28,672
One of the examples I mentioned was the three doors

11
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:32,256
Problem where the rules of the game out of the game show host

12
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:36,608
Hides the prize behind one of the three doors at random

13
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:38,656
Player

14
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:40,448
Chooses one of the doors

15
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:44,288
For example I might choose to a Woman Soon by the Blue Cycle

16
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:48,640
Then the host promises that he will open another door

17
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:51,456
In such a way as to reveal the prize

18
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:56,320
Then the play I will be given the chance to stake for switch

19
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:58,624
On display switch to me

20
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:02,464
Get what's behind the other closed-door

21
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:06,816
In this case would be fine.

22
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,984
So the rules explained then play the game the player chooses a one-horse open

23
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,384
3 revealing nothing as promised should you sticks with towards it make no difference and last time

24
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,992
Budget on this everyone knows now because that you should switch

25
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:32,160
And what I want you to know is hard to answer this sort of problem in general because

26
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:36,512
Maybe people have memorized that they should switch but I still don't actually know

27
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:40,352
How to answer inference

28
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:46,752
The general rule for how to solve inference problems is right down the joint probability of everything

29
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,312
Then condition on what you know

30
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:55,968
And then you'll have the right answer and that that's a universal rule for solving probability problems

31
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:01,600
That have any inference element to them often when you do that when you

32
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:08,000
Write down the probability of everything then condition on some data what you'll end up doing how's a particular phone

33
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,792
How much is home base theorem

34
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:12,352
So in general

35
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:18,752
The Joint probability of everything can often be written as shown in the top right-hand side of the Top Line

36
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:25,152
How's the prior probability of some hypotheses which could account for the X

37
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,944
Turn hypothesis

38
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,784
And then when you condition on a particular date outcome

39
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,856
You got the thing on the left hand side the posterior probability

40
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,648
Off your hypotheses candidate

41
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,696
Is that joint probability

42
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:40,768
Normalized / the data that actually happened

43
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:46,656
So let's illustrate how this works for the three the three doors

44
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:53,056
We got three doors the price could be behind any of them

45
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:56,640
And in this particular situation but player has

46
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:03,040
Chosen dong before the date or is going to be which door

47
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:06,880
Does the game show host go and open so we actually know that

48
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:13,280
The positive could be he might open till 2 or he might open till 3

49
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:18,656
Papa sees that the prize is behind door 1 go to

50
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,936
Endur3

51
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:22,496
Federal my notation

52
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:28,896
The hypotheses are there is one two or three that prior probabilities are

53
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:31,712
Because the price could be anywhere

54
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:34,784
Now what's the likelihood what's the probability

55
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,184
If H is true that you got D equals 3y let's go through the the three cases if the prices

56
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,720
Between behind

57
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:49,120
The one then the car free choice of opening door to order three so these two days outcomes

58
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:52,960
Play likely how

59
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:58,080
Are the hosts picks the door when he has a free choice. Hahaha

60
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:03,200
So the probability of the day can being free given. Believe H is a half

61
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:09,600
Egg surprises behind door then he's obliged to open till 3

62
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:13,184
So the probability is warm of keeping 3

63
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,815
It surprises behind all three then he's not allowed to open.

64
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,119
So the probability of that happening

65
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,399
Is there a

66
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:29,311
So that's the probability of a data under the three hypotheses a way of thinking about doing is the price

67
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,359
How probable hypotheses where

68
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,895
Before we go

69
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:39,551
When the likelihood is is measuring how well did the results predict what actually happened and you reward

70
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:45,695
Things that predict well do that

71
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:50,815
And then you had you can work out of foot x 1/2

72
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:56,959
And we add those up together normalizing constants and adds up to

73
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:01,055
So now when we multiply those two across

74
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:07,455
We got normalize by dividing by half

75
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,479
2 / 1/2

76
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,015
I got two phones

77
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:17,183
Incidentally what is this normalizing well that's how well you would predict the dates that happened given

78
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:23,327
State of prior knowledge we don't actually know which hypothesis is true I asked you okay then

79
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:29,983
The players chosen to a warm you hung up a clue where the prize is what do you think's going to happen

80
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:36,639
Peanuts

81
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:39,455
Open is a half if you don't know where

82
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,015
Take away the prizes

83
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:48,415
Okay so that's what we normalized with and posterior probability is popping out

84
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,695
Right inside

85
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,463
2/3

86
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:54,559
Therefore you should switch get you a chance of winning

87
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,607
If you switch

88
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:59,935
Okay so that is Bayes theorem and

89
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:04,287
We will need to use that one with letting with channels as well if we have a

90
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,871
I want to infer what the input of a channel was

91
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,175
When we see the output

92
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:16,319
Unless time we Define how to measure information

93
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:22,975
For a joint Ensemble with two random variables in it so trivially we re

94
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:29,375
Able to define the joint and feed because that's just the same as interview with many with redefine the muslin

95
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,935
PH of Aksum

96
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:35,775
That we Define things called conditional entropy sites of x given y

97
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:39,359
Head fi given X I need to find a single the mutual information

98
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:42,431
If your right eye of X semicolon y

99
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,223
And

100
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:51,135
The mutual information is a measure of how much dependents that is between the two random variables

101
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:58,559
Okay so that's what we did last time and now we're going to talk about noisy channels and we're building up to

102
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:04,447
The Pinnacle of this bit of the cost which is the assertion that if you got yourself a noisy Channel

103
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,543
Like the binary symmetric Channel which flips the function f of the best

104
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:14,943
It is possible even though it's an unreliable going to channel to communicate reliably over that channel by the

105
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,551
Coming construction of an appropriate encoding and decoding scheme

106
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:24,927
Communication arbitrarily close to perfect reliability

107
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:31,071
So what we're going to do now is repeat what we did in the last batch Oregon today

108
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:37,471
For the case of noisy channels how does inference work and what are the information measures for noisy Channel

109
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,239
This works

110
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:44,639
Is a channel itself only to find a set of conditional probability distribution

111
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:51,039
We have to invent some input distribution then we can talk about the joint distribution of the input and the output

112
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:54,367
And we can also talk about information messages

113
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,159
So

114
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,695
Once we

115
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:01,023
Take the channel which has in green

116
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:05,119
A set of conditional distribution the probability of the output given the input

117
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,143
If we then

118
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,423
Bring along

119
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:13,823
I didn't put distribution that's under our control we can invent the info distribution is there vaccine purple you multiply those

120
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,127
Two together and you get to Joint distribution

121
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:18,687
With that distribution you can do in fruits

122
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:24,319
You can also compute the mutual information between the input and the output

123
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,855
In the way we Define last week

124
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,927
So that's the game plan

125
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:35,583
Throw play with channels a little bit will do some inference will compute some information measures

126
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,983
And then we'll talk about how that relates to be noisy Channel coding serum that says you can actually communicate reliably over these things

127
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,543
Let me tell you some channels

128
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:52,735
Set a favorite channel is already up there on the screen

129
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,831
The binary symmetric Channel

130
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:04,255
Which flips a fraction F of the bits we can represent that channel if we want

131
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:10,655
Buy a transition probability Matrix sorry I'm Matrix of conditional distributions

132
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:17,055
And I'll write it this way around with Ulta and his values of the input across the top

133
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,079
An alternative

134
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,359
Outfits

135
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,639
Abound

136
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,199
Aside

137
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,991
So if x is

138
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:27,295
Sarah Wong

139
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:32,159
The progressive output p01 is respectively

140
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,791
So that's one channel

141
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:41,375
Has another one

142
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,775
His one instantly is called binary because it's got two inputs into outputs it's called symmetric B cost

143
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:54,175
There is a symmetry if you interchange their own Walnut the inputs and outputs

144
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:54,943
Got the same

145
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,711
Channel

146
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,527
Here's another one it's cool binary

147
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,063
Eraser Channel

148
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:06,719
And this is a great toy model of another another phenomenon that happens in communication

149
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,999
Which is sometimes

150
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:14,399
Your message doesn't come out of the other end correctly and the receiving who's that

151
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:20,031
They still don't know what you actually sent so they have a symbol cold?

152
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,871
And the probability say f

153
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:27,967
Off a? Coming out

154
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,039
All right

155
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,831
Saturday

156
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:39,999
7 conditional probabilities for that Channel with my kids 4-0

157
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:48,703
Channels don't have to be symmetric you can have asymmetric channels

158
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,751
Lisette Channel

159
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,823
Islam whenever you send the zero

160
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,919
It's received perfectly I whenever you send a wall

161
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:03,295
Maybe got a 100 Maybe

162
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:17,887
Okay so in general set of conditional distributions is

163
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:24,287
Represented by matrix QJ given I is the probability that the output

164
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:29,919
Is element BJ and output alphabet given that the input force

165
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,455
I

166
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:35,551
Hindi alphabets

167
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:42,463
And I've got one more favorite example which is the noisy typewriter which is up on the screen of the noisy typewriter

168
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:46,559
Is a channel where the inputs of the

169
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:49,375
27 keys

170
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:55,775
On a typewriter but what actually comes out isn't necessarily the key that you did

171
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,055
It may be the one

172
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:03,455
Either side left or right there is a probability of 1/3

173
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:10,879
Each when you hit the see that you got to see a b or a d and so forth with

174
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:14,207
Circular symmetry I'm imagining a circular keyboard if you like

175
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:18,559
Text so that's the note the typewriter

176
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:33,663
And what we going to do with these channels his we're going to the first imagine that we spray some random data from

177
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,503
An input distribution that we got to Define into the channel

178
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,063
And we're going to the

179
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:43,391
As it says on the screen to find a joint ensemble

180
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:49,791
BMX X people like an X we're going to do and I'm going to compete how much information is conveyed

181
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,327
Let's stop

182
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,887
Where is the binary symmetric Channel

183
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:55,935
And

184
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:00,287
Will pick a particular time over the particular

185
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:05,151
Probability so let's say it flips 10% of its

186
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,575
And then

187
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,903
So what I mean

188
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:19,999
Okay then we need to pick an input distribution

189
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:24,351
So let's pick this

190
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:32,031
This input distribution

191
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:39,199
Probability of a 0.92 probability of a long

192
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:41,503
Can I be .1 Oregon to

193
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:46,879
Send I have been coin sequence with lots of zeros in a few ones

194
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:47,903
Into the channel

195
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:52,255
So it's praying in these bits and out of coming outputs

196
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,535
Why

197
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,423
I don't want you to assume

198
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:03,519
Then we look at a particular moment and we observe

199
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:06,847
For the output of a channel is

200
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:09,407
How many question is given this

201
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,967
I put

202
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,831
What we think the infamous

203
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:22,719
Okay please work this out what's the probability

204
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:26,815
Fat

205
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:29,631
Ex was one

206
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:36,543
How is it with Sarah please change your neighbor and

207
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,383
Let's workout enhancer

208
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,295
Okay

209
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,367
Time to vote

210
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:57,023
If you're still looking at sorry you can vote for the sandwiches I don't know if you want

211
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,815
Can a few to choose from hair

212
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:03,423
Vote for that I don't know what the probability is that X is one

213
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,007
Reverse

214
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:11,359
Votes for a 0.1

215
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,175
Votes for be

216
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,247
502c

217
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:18,783
Free

218
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,575
Look for something else

219
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:23,135
Is lost shoes from

220
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:28,255
Right through this

221
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,559
What's the probability that the

222
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:33,887
Water bong

223
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:40,799
The right time bass there and we need to Joint probability on the right hand side

224
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:45,407
As is normal with a sediment and looks like this you got your priorities

225
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:48,735
On the inputs and Hood

226
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:55,903
Hyundai minivan normalizing constant which is the probability that you see the

227
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:02,303
Data that you've actually seen and that's a song over all possible values of a

228
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,071
X

229
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:09,215
All the things we have upset the normalizing constant given

230
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:14,591
PAX Prime

231
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:17,407
VFX Prime

232
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,967
Sir

233
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,783
I need the probability of

234
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:29,183
If you put a woman chance of getting a woman out the answer to that his point nine because the flip is Tempest

235
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,487
Send .9

236
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:35,839
The lights hit the prior probability of having a Wong

237
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,399
Is there is no point one

238
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:45,055
100 / the normalizing constant which is the sum of all the times roll a different X4

239
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:49,407
Donations of what we saw by the first exclamation we got swept out is that

240
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:55,039
It was a warm and it didn't get flipped but the other explanation is it wasn't too warm

241
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,855
And it did Netflix

242
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,903
And the probability of it

243
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,439
Not being alone

244
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,279
8.9

245
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,815
The probability of it

246
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:10,143
Being flipped is .1 I just said

247
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,167
And made sense

248
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,215
Any questions or eclair

249
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:17,567
So these are the two 2 explanations

250
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,359
When you talk them up

251
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:24,479
We can make a note of what the program that have a y equaling warm is

252
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,527
Which is not .1

253
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:27,807
Thanks

254
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:33,951
And it just happens when we looking at but it will consoles have a nice day we get off

255
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,743
So the correct answer

256
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,535
There's a huff

257
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,095
Any questions

258
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,495
If we observe the output why

259
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,543
Is 0 instead

260
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,567
Then

261
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:55,455
What's the probability that x equals 1

262
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,807
I don't want to

263
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:02,367
How's it guess what the answer to this is

264
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:07,231
If you see a zero the chance to Texas Bon

265
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,791
Just like us

266
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:11,583
Huff

267
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,887
An advance on Hoffner

268
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,167
What do you think

269
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:18,239
Muffler

270
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:23,359
Yeah less than Point Mall

271
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:30,783
Set upstairs

272
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,343
All the prior probability of getting a

273
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:39,231
The probability of a flip happening

274
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,863
Stop says we have point 19.1

275
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:51,263
Probably about one being put in his only 10%

276
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:54,079
His 10% then downstairs

277
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,871
We have

278
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,663
That

279
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,943
Plus

280
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,479
The other way

281
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,759
Getting

282
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,807
Azera out

283
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,599
Which is what was put in

284
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,159
Wasn't there I didn't get flipped

285
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:11,743
So that's .9 spread fishes .81

286
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:18,399
Find the probability of seeing white cuz there is no

287
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:28,127
How about we go upstairs is 1 what week is 8200

288
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,919
Swan

289
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,199
Nova

290
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,991
82

291
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:35,807
Okay

292
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,087
So we find out

293
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,135
Two interesting things along the way

294
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:40,927
Weave

295
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,743
Workout for each of these cases

296
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:50,399
Not only what the probability of the input is now that we've seen the output how long the way

297
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,679
What the probability

298
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,215
I'm guessing that

299
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,263
Output Wieck was wrong

300
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:00,383
It's all the publicity cutting like was there something wrong

301
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:06,783
8218 has to be the case

302
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,623
Today's episode of fantasy checks you can apply if your account

303
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,159
DeSoto questions

304
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:16,255
Very good we've done inference

305
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:21,887
And in this particular case if you see a zero coming out it's very unlikely the input walls

306
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:22,911
I want

307
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,263
No having done inference

308
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,311
We are very well equipped

309
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,615
To talk about information messages

310
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:38,527
So we can for example ask a question in General on average given this

311
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:42,623
Functions that we just chose that for the channel and the input distribution

312
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,415
How much information

313
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:50,303
Does the input convey about the output or actually more interesting around how much

314
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,143
Information that the output convey about the input

315
00:20:55,423 --> 00:21:01,311
That we're interested in how much information is conveyed

316
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,335
How about

317
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,127
Input

318
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,175
Bye

319
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,711
The output

320
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:16,159
Mutual information and it is x - 8y

321
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:22,560
And it also is a y - 8

322
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:25,120
Why give an ex

323
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,936
Pictures of slightly remarkable

324
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:34,336
I got to see what this one is saying is the amount of information you gain on average is how much information

325
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,104
Text had

326
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:37,664
Intrinsically without knowing output

327
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:42,272
- how much information can it is still has when you have seen them

328
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:43,808
Okay

329
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:49,952
A message saying you can do it the other way around you can just ask what's the information content of the output

330
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:53,024
And how much information does the output still have

331
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,560
If you know the input

332
00:21:55,072 --> 00:22:00,192
Whenever you want to compute the mutual information for a channel you're free to do it either way

333
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,520
But that it is that quite often

334
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:09,920
This way of doing the calculation is a little bit easier found this way

335
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:10,944
Play less

336
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,712
What

337
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:13,248
Not always nice

338
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,784
But

339
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:18,112
Let's do it both ways so you can see what I mean

340
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:20,160
So they're the first way

341
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:25,024
Set to do the first way we need to

342
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,840
Which way am I doing it

343
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:34,496
My notes didn't do the easy way first we need to know

344
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,776
The entropy of lie

345
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:37,568
What's the probability of Y

346
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,336
It

347
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,872
.82

348
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:46,528
.18 and that was a fairly easy thing to to workout and it's also easy to work out

349
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,064
Epic property distribution

350
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,344
We're on foot

351
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,368
Stop

352
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,672
Hrvy is

353
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:57,280
H2O .18 this is a binary entropy function

354
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,584
Which be defined in the first electric

355
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,120
No

356
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,168
If you know

357
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,704
The input of a channel

358
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,496
Now what the entropy of lie

359
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:07,520
Well

360
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,800
Eva

361
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:12,384
It's Anthony this distribution

362
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,992
The Centre of this distribution

363
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:24,416
And those distributions both have the same niche because each other so the average of

364
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:28,512
And the entropy of this one it doesn't matter

365
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,792
We see this

366
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:32,864
Damsa is Christian faith of

367
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,936
Divine Right theory of s

368
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,752
Is Enfield output

369
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,288
Give an ex

370
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:41,824
Okay

371
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:47,456
So now we just

372
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,528
Look up Viner enfps

373
00:23:54,112 --> 00:24:00,256
Maybe for the sake of the record or justifying what function is again

374
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:20,224
So we float back into our

375
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,832
How can I tell if we got these two numbers out where is no point one

376
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,880
Track

377
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,928
Andrew. 0 point

378
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:29,952
2

379
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,488
Bon

380
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,512
Pets

381
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,096
So that was

382
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:39,424
Fairly painless we just have to work out and not for distribution

383
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,448
And then

384
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,056
The conditional entropy of the output given the input was a very easy thing to write down

385
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:48,128
We can also do the calculation the other way around

386
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:52,736
And my judgment is it slightly harder book to do this one

387
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:56,064
We have to stop by working out

388
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:02,464
Diviners fee 4.1

389
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,488
Ancient

390
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:08,096
And then this one you do have to work out all the terms

391
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,888
This entry

392
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:16,288
Input given output is the sum over all possible output waited by have trouble with his that you got that

393
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:20,896
Then what is the entry of the input for that particular value

394
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,432
The Outpost

395
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,504
That we need to talk up

396
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,320
All of those possibilities

397
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:33,440
Does .18 chance that the output might

398
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,464
B

399
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:39,072
The first one we can say this name Lee yeah I put might be one

400
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:43,424
Bottom brackets

401
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:49,568
And then in that case the entropy of the input giving why is the entropy of this distribution 50/50

402
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:56,480
Terminate Divine rent fee of the 50/50 distribution

403
00:25:57,504 --> 00:26:00,576
Then to finish off this calculation here

404
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:03,392
We need the 82% chance

405
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,464
That the output will actually be

406
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,744
0

407
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,304
Multiplying diviner entropy

408
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,328
All

409
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:18,496
The probability of the input given that the output is why we work.

410
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:22,848
That is not probability distribution is 182

411
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,896
81-82

412
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:34,368
Alright so now we go Presley Presley with the calculator look out by 9 p.m. off the Bunny Ranch.

413
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:40,768
182 I'm already have to work out this phone right now so that's three minor injuries which is a bit of a fast

414
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:46,400
Plus we have to do Bayes theorem to get this number I might have to do bass tournament you got this number

415
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:53,056
So that's why it feels like a bit more work we do last week at Point full 7 -

416
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,592
.26

417
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:55,872
Which is

418
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:58,688
What you want

419
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:02,016
How does old measured in bits and that's the same answer

420
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,832
As it

421
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:05,856
Should be

422
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,160
Okay

423
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:14,560
So what are we done we introduced the channel we pick our own input distribution pay it was completely

424
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:16,096
We could have picked anything

425
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:18,400
And then we worked out

426
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:22,752
The mutual information between the input and the output

427
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:23,776
Of the channel

428
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:30,688
And we had a completely free choice of the input distribution and what we just went through was

429
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:31,712
Special case

430
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,480
Fat

431
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,016
The probability of x

432
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,808
Equaling Wong

433
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,088
Walls

434
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,136
.1

435
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:46,816
Handful that special case here we have worked out

436
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:49,632
Putnam Mutual affection walls

437
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:53,472
I'll punch you want

438
00:27:57,056 --> 00:28:01,408
And we could have picked any input distribution anything between 0

439
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,176
Moana

440
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:05,504
And we can repeat the whole calculation we just did

441
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,856
Broly

442
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:16,768
Housing value stab between so please do that now

443
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:28,032
Okay are you done

444
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:35,200
So when you complete the cuff

445
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:38,016
You got something looks like this

446
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,368
If you always put zeros into the channel then the

447
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,696
Output doesn't convey anything about the input anymore

448
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:48,000
If you always put in ones

449
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,024
Holset

450
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:51,072
It conveys

451
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,096
Information

452
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:58,496
It's a symmetric channel so this code must be symmetric and it's going up so it's going to have a maximum somewhere

453
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,776
Should I just catch

454
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:04,384
By symmetry the maximum and you can prove that has a homework

455
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,176
Exercise if you are

456
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,712
Skeptically inclined

457
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,368
Suck

458
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:19,232
What you going to do with this now

459
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:21,024
Hippie idea

460
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:24,864
We're going to introduce the definition

461
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:34,080
We had a free choice of this input distribution I didn't label axis of x equals 1

462
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:37,152
I did leg lifts my wife

463
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:38,688
Okay

464
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,504
We got a free choice of the input distribution

465
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:46,880
Something we could do is we could hunt around in the space of all possible input distribution

466
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:53,280
For the one that maximizes the mutual information wouldn't that be an interesting thing to do because then

467
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:55,072
Sucks that you have maximum

468
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:58,144
You took summation between input and output

469
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:03,264
So well then Define the thing that we get from that

470
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,592
To be the capacity of the channel

471
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:13,248
If I don't give you a channel you can say the capacity of that channel Q is the

472
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:17,088
Maximum overall possible input distributions PX

473
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:21,696
Alstom Eastlink Nation between the input

474
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,720
And the output

475
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:28,864
And the distribution does the chief this maximum is called the optimal input

476
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,144
Distribution

477
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,168
Set a timer

478
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:35,008
For example

479
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,640
For the binary symmetric Channel

480
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:44,224
With a flip probability app

481
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:46,016
Appoint Wong

482
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:52,416
Helpful input distribution

483
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:57,792
Is

484
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:00,352
Hahaha

485
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,400
Buy Cemetery

486
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,752
Or if you don't believe symmetry arguments let me prove it to you

487
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:21,856
Suck what is the mutual information for any choice of input distribution

488
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:28,256
I'll introduce a variable P1 which is the probability of picking warm as

489
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,888
Input distribution

490
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:46,688
As I bury the number P1 what happens to Mutual information wow we need

491
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:50,272
I said the easy way

492
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,576
We need the entropy of Y

493
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:55,392
We need the entropy of line given X

494
00:31:56,928 --> 00:32:03,072
So we need the Envy of what's the probability that the outfit will be one well

495
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:06,144
Guess it by putting in a woman having a

496
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:08,704
Slipknot happen

497
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,776
You can get it by putting in a knot

498
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,664
H2O that lost

499
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:24,576
This is sorry I'm working at the age of Y -8

500
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,344
All

501
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,672
Why give an ex the second time is

502
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:35,584
What's entropy of Y given X will it doesn't matter what the input distribution is the entropy of Y if you know the input is always

503
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,120
Kevin Durant free

504
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,728
I can't answer that

505
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:44,800
The answer that something we just sketched and now you sketch this

506
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,336
And you put your proof

507
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,896
Okay it's not the complete proof

508
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,944
You can prove it it's in the book as well

509
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,784
When you maximize this

510
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:01,184
What you got is what the capacity of the finest metric Channel

511
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,560
Where the flip probability of f- H2

512
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,584
Of f

513
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:15,264
Okay what's the biggest value of the binary entropy function can possibly have

514
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,080
The biggest failure can have is Wong

515
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:22,944
H2O Banks his axe

516
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,992
Space between

517
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:29,088
The biggest failure can have his it's a chief when the argument in hair

518
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,112
Heather Hoff

519
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:37,024
QED the biggest the biggest Mutual information you can have is 1 - 8

520
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,304
Some people

521
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,424
I need a cheap that by making sure the argument are the Hof

522
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,192
And

523
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:50,336
Indy setting P1 equal to 1/2 does not for you

524
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,896
So what we works out

525
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:53,920
Is

526
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:55,456
The capacity

527
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:57,760
All the binary symmetric Channel

528
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:00,832
For the flight from

529
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:10,816
I'm not what we want to do next is exploring this idea what is the capacity of a channel

530
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:15,168
But the real goal is to prove that this capacity

531
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:18,496
Actually measures how fast you can reliably communicate

532
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:24,896
Over-the-counter medicine amazingly profound results that will get that by the end of the next lecture

533
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:32,064
So where were heading is waterproof Shannon's noisy Channel coding theory which says that

534
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:37,440
Reliable that is virtually error-free communication is possible over this channel

535
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:39,232
Heart rates up to

536
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,048
At any rate up to the capacity

537
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,328
Off the channel

538
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,400
Okay

539
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:49,472
So let's do a few more examples

540
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:52,032
And then next time we will

541
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:54,080
Indicate how to prove

542
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,616
Esterom

543
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:12,000
So for the binary symmetric Timeless and also to lobbyists that you can communicate reliably at this right

544
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:15,072
If we're talking about the Channel with a flip probability of

545
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:17,376
Traffic report no .1

546
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:24,544
And this capacity is roughly 0.53

547
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:29,920
So that the assertion in the steering is that you can take

548
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:33,248
Lousy destroys it flipped empcenter the best

549
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:35,808
Combine two of them together in a coming way

550
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:39,136
And you can achieve that you can emulate

551
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,416
A perfect

552
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:44,000
Single disk drive using the two lousy distress

553
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:51,936
So that's not obvious let's look at some other example channels where maybe it's a little bit more

554
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,824
Weather this theorem is correct

555
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,128
So let's start by looking at

556
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:02,432
A Channel with 4 inputs

557
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,968
Before outputs

558
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,504
Which has this

559
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,112
Set of conditional probabilities

560
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:13,952
Please work out what the capacity of this channel is

561
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:20,608
And then when you're done. See if you can invent an encoding and decoding method to communicate that not right

562
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:21,632
Original

563
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:31,872
Okay what is the optimal input distribution first

564
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:33,408
Hello

565
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:36,480
Uniform distribution

566
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:42,880
Seems reasonable gas by Cemetery

567
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,000
And what the capacity if you use

568
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,792
Fat input distribution

569
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,888
Two bits

570
00:36:55,168 --> 00:37:01,312
So where does that come from well we can run it on either way and to be off

571
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:05,920
Output - entry lamp given inputs for example

572
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:13,088
If you use this input distribution the output distribution is also uniform

573
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:16,416
The Envy of the uniform distribution

574
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,184
Is

575
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:20,512
Two bits because it's

576
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,304
Look for

577
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:28,192
And if you know what the input is the entropy of output

578
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,288
Is 0 because it's a certain distribution

579
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:42,528
Can we communicate reliably with this channel

580
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:44,320
Yes because you could

581
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:50,720
Take someone who's going to lay the bits and you can say every time you get 00010

582
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:57,120
411 respectively for the next two bits and turn them into ABC's and he's in there and then use

583
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:58,144
Coming back again

584
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:01,472
A cut that's a trivial case

585
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,056
Let's now

586
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:07,360
Mention two more cases

587
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:09,152
Which will do

588
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:12,224
In the next lecture

589
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:16,576
Sebastian High School Veterinary confusion Channel

590
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:19,136
And

591
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,440
If you put in

592
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:23,488
ASU

593
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,352
Will you put in sees you cannot answer that you put in these you got

594
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,912
Random Moon

595
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,960
A cat

596
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,288
So where we heading with this task

597
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:42,688
His we want to know what's the optimal input distribution but the start with let me ask you if you put in a third of those

598
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:44,992
Now

599
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:46,784
What's the nutrition information

600
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:49,344
So have a chance your neighbor

601
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,440
And look at an answer for that and then if you

602
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:55,488
If you've done the first questions

603
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:59,840
The next question is what the helpful input distribution and what capacity

604
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:06,240
So when I say what's a tax obviously answers you're not sure what I'm really asking is what

605
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:10,080
What is the probability distribution of x given that information

606
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,272
Okay

607
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:22,624
Answer to this first question what is

608
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:24,672
Access streaming

609
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:28,256
Simple distribution and assuming that you see an output

610
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:29,792
Y equals m

611
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:33,120
What's the probability distribution of x

612
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:36,192
Any guesses or answers

613
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:40,288
No

614
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:48,224
What could X be

615
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,248
Christian

616
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:51,040
It could be a or b

617
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:54,112
Are they equally likely

618
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:02,304
Let me give you a hint

619
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:04,864
Okay

620
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,912
This is called a

621
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,728
Chris coetzee

622
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:14,592
The way the channel looks physical be

623
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:15,872
Okay

624
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:17,920
When you pick it in foot

625
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:21,504
You pick a card you pick one of the three times at uboc

626
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,320
And then it got plops down on the table at random

627
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:27,136
Am I going to swamp all this phone

628
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,416
All this one

629
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:32,000
And what the output is m o n is

630
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:33,792
Is it white or is it brown

631
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:35,584
Okay

632
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:37,632
Senna

633
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:41,984
If u c y equals n which means you see

634
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,264
Wise

635
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:48,384
What's the probability that the input was the old white count

636
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,920
I was supposed to say

637
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:52,992
But it was be the double-sided car

638
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:55,296
Annual

639
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,088
It's going to be

640
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:04,000
2/3 1/3

641
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,536
Vera

642
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:11,168
If you had last week then this was all familiar

643
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,216
Okay

644
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:15,776
So two guys once I was there

645
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:19,872
And what is the meatloaf mation please turn to your neighbor and

646
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:21,664
What passage

647
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:29,856
Okay

648
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:37,536
What's the meatloaf Nation assuming this input distribution his five things we should choose from or

649
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:40,352
Omega is something else is I've not written down

650
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,144
Are you ready

651
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,960
Votes for option A

652
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:46,240
Lug

653
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:49,312
Base 2 of 3

654
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:51,872
Minus the vitamin B12

655
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,151
Did I say that

656
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:58,527
Boats that 1-2 feta cheese 2/3

657
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:00,831
K12

658
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:03,391
Votes for a luxury - of head

659
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,951
Biloxi - Wang

660
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:09,023
1/2 - 1/3

661
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:12,863
For something else

662
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:16,703
I should have asked for that first

663
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:17,471
Okay

664
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:21,055
Right sorry I didn't give you a quite long enough that

665
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:26,175
So probably I should have left you a little bit longer cuz the interesting thing is

666
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:32,575
Typically if you have a careful audience about half of the people vote for a day and a half of the people

667
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:36,159
Because both of these are correct

668
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:42,559
And you get each of them budging the constellation the two different possible ways around so you can either say what the entropy

669
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:48,959
The input distribution Lottery and then

670
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:55,359
Find distribution whichever thing happen that's a very quick

671
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,639
4/8 -

672
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:58,175
The Bunny Ranch Riverside

673
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:00,735
Thanks for this is correct

674
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:05,087
But it's also true you can about this way you can send me the output

675
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:07,903
So if I pick a card and show you

676
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:09,183
The face

677
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:12,511
What the prophecy between black or white brown or white

678
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,047
That's

679
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:17,119
1 bit 50/50

680
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:21,727
And what's the entropy of the output if you know the input

681
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:28,127
If you know the input now you have to some over all the possible cases does Longford Champs

682
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:34,015
That you certainly got the output and so a certain distribution has no entropy

683
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:36,575
Results of a 1/3 chance

684
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:40,159
That you pick a c and have a such an n

685
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,951
Which has no entropy

686
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:43,743
And does a 1/3 chance

687
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:45,023
That you pick

688
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:47,071
The brown and white cars

689
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:53,471
How does a 50-50 chance you'll see Brian White romantically of that distribution

690
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:54,495
Is one bit

691
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,407
Which gets here

692
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:02,943
1 - 1/3

693
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:03,967
Which is correct

694
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:10,367
Supposed to be Santa's alright and it's nothing Philadelphia's but these two mathematical quantities are equal to each other

695
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:11,903
Okay

696
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:13,183
Sun

697
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:16,255
The next question is

698
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:18,303
What's the capacity

699
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,583
Office Channel

700
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:21,631
All right

701
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:28,031
That means you not get to pick the input distribution you want to think of a better

702
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:29,055
Input distribution

703
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:32,895
If someone's going to pick one of these cars to try and communicate with you

704
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:35,711
What distribution would you like them to

705
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:36,735
Pick from

706
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:37,503
So that

707
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:40,831
You can communicate as much as possible

708
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:42,367
Habitat to neva

709
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:51,583
Okay

710
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:56,703
What's a polenta input distribution and what's the capacity

711
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:06,687
Okay they'll probably put the three shoes a half note Bowie throw away this stupid car

712
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:13,087
Because it's useless it doesn't help adjust injection noise we keep these two and the capacity is

713
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:21,279
One bit because now we've got ourselves a channel that looks like that

714
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,559
Two inputs to outputs

715
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:24,095
Okay

716
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:25,887
Very good

717
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:28,191
Any questions

718
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:34,847
Right so that was a slightly silly channel

719
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:38,175
Next time we will stop with this

720
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:43,295
Very simple but slightly more interesting channel the noisy typewriter

721
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:44,575
It's

722
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:46,367
Circular symmetry

723
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:49,183
Every input Master three possible outputs

724
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:51,999
How many questions are what built into distribution

725
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:53,023
And what is

726
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:54,303
The capacity

727
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:56,095
What's up with that question

728
00:45:56,351 --> 00:46:02,495
Then we will prove the noisy time of coding theorem at least for the binary symmetric Channel and in the book you can find a

729
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:03,263
The General

730
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,287
Prefix well

731
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:10,175
Finally has some recommended homework for you to do some recommended exercises

732
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:11,711
On the website

733
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:18,111
Which you can find by looking for ITP RNN there's a hand with some more recommended exercise

734
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:19,391
Sizes from the book

735
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:25,791
And also does some software on the website if you want to make Huffman programs in or around if you want to have a husband

736
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:28,095
Program that makes optimal Huffman codes

737
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:34,495
For you this is especially for the day's compression exercise but I said please make a

738
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:36,543
Compression method to compress

739
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:37,823
Annapolis MD

740
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,895
Bent coin with lots of zeros in a small number of ones

741
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:44,735
Okay thanks so much for coming and

742
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,527
See you next time hopefully

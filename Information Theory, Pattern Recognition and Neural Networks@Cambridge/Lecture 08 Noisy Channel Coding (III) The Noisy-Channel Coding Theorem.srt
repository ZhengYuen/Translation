00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:11,264
Welcome to lecture 8 of information Theory pattern recognition and neural networks

2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:17,664
This is one of the Pinnacles of the course where we will prove what for me is one of the

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,552
Mathematics of the 20th century Channel coding theorem

4
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:29,952
I will prove it the proof is in the book will give us proof

5
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:33,536
Complete proof for a special case

6
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:34,560
Today

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,984
What have we been well last lecture we defined the capacity of a channel

8
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,848
What channel is a set of inputs each which gives you a probability distribution

9
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:52,736
The way you get the capacity of the channel is you invent a probability distribution on the inputs

10
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:59,136
You been to find the mutual information between the inputs and outputs and you maximize at Mutual information

11
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
With respect to the auditory input distribution as a theoretical constructs that gives you this

12
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:06,816
Ticketmaster

13
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:13,728
And what we're going to prove today is that this isn't just an interesting number it is actually the rate at which

14
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:17,824
Virtually every communication is possible over that

15
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,456
That's a really remarkable thing is something for nothing result that

16
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:29,856
You kind of cheap reliable communication I-10 right as big as the capacity

17
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:38,816
So last time we Define the capacity and we started looking at a few simple examples of channels and asking the question

18
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:45,216
What is the capacity of this channel we looked at a few and I left you at the exercise

19
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,496
I'm looking at

20
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:53,152
The question is what is the optimal input distribution of this noise

21
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:58,784
And what's its capacity so please turn to your neighbor and discuss your answer to this

22
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,808
Question

23
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:10,976
Okay who's got a capacity first what's the capacity of this channel

24
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:13,536
Honeywell

25
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,144
Okay let me take you to it

26
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:25,056
It's the maximum possible vehicle information that you can get between input and output what's the mutual information

27
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:28,384
Well you can write it in a

28
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,784
Pair of different ways you can say it's the entropy of the output minus the entropy of the output

29
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,088
Conditional on the input

30
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:40,672
And we want to maximize that

31
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,952
So

32
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,256
What are these two objects

33
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,840
Well the second one is

34
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:50,912
What's a trivia on the input and

35
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:57,312
Any input gives rise to three possibilities with equal probability distribution you choose

36
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:00,384
Answer to this quantity is it just log

37
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,944
No choice about that

38
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:11,136
What's the entropy of the output while it's the Envy of what I've a distribution you end up spitting out onto the outputs if you were

39
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:15,488
S&B then you get a distribution that without your log 3

40
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:21,887
Bits of entropy but if you use a r uniform Distribution on head

41
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:29,055
What the biggest possible entropy you could get on why the output answer the uniform distribution

42
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:34,943
Can you achieve that yes I just told you one way of doing that so the answer is log 27

43
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:42,879
That's the maximum value that this can happen so this is the answer which is load nice

44
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:51,071
Capacity and the optimal input distribution is the input distribution that achieves

45
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,375
Maximum entropy on the outputs

46
00:04:53,887 --> 00:05:00,031
By symmetry one way of doing that is to pick the uniform distribution so the optimal

47
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:06,431
Distribution is 137 137 137

48
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,087
And that is an input distribution for the Chiefs this maximum

49
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:18,463
Does anyone have any suggestion of an alternative input distribution

50
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:21,535
Is this the unique one or the other alternatives

51
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:29,471
Great so if you pick only the letters s a b e e h

52
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,031
Then

53
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:37,663
You're putting one

54
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:41,247
On each of those options everything

55
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:49,951
This has been nice property still that a uniform Distribution on those inputs Will Smith a uniform

56
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:56,351
Distribution of the outputs achieved its maximum

57
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:02,751
Nobody way of communicating reliably with the noisy type-ahead Channel namely you never use the other

58
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:06,079
You just use it and puts beh and Zedd

59
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:12,479
And therefore you can communicate reliably how fast can you communicate reliably 12 each time

60
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:17,599
You can take one of nine possible inputs that fall you will be today at 9

61
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,135
Fitspo YouTube channel

62
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:22,975
So this is another case slightly more interesting than the ones we had

63
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,999
Last week

64
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:28,863
This is a case where we can find a way of reliably communicating

65
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:35,263
At capacity of a noisy Channel coding theorem is true for this channel is giving us a bit of inside

66
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:41,663
How we actually sold communication over noisy channels one of the messages of today's lecture is going to be

67
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,503
That if you use any channel a lot of times

68
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,783
In sequence

69
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:50,623
Send a collection of say and uses of

70
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,415
Your noisy channel is a lot like

71
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:56,255
A noisy typewriter typewriter

72
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,535
Applies to

73
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,327
Noisy channels in general

74
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,887
So where we going

75
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,167
Is

76
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:08,031
We want to establish Shannon's noisy Channel coding Theory which says

77
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,823
Set for any channel

78
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,503
There exists coding schemes

79
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:22,111
Ditch Witch will have a rate and a

80
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:25,183
An era write a frequency of mistakes

81
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:31,327
Coding theorem says that you can achieve everywhere in this diagram

82
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:37,727
Right way down Albuquerque close to zero error probability while keeping the rate finite at

83
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,287
Which we have just defined

84
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,871
Maximum beats information

85
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,663
Is achievable

86
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:50,527
Plaza is known as evil and the exciting part

87
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,319
Of this theorem

88
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,647
Is

89
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:00,511
Respect the fact that you can get arbitrarily close to zero

90
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,535
With

91
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,351
Communication rights as close as you like to the capacity

92
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,911
So this is the really exciting

93
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,959
Part of the diagram

94
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:09,983
That

95
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,287
And that's what we're going to prove

96
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,055
Today

97
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:21,503
Namely that you can get anywhere in here as well that proved in the book and the fact that you come

98
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,855
Achieve anything over here is also approved in the book we wouldn't do that today

99
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,487
So his the only deer

100
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:36,863
Why we should believe this is true for a general Channel

101
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:40,447
We can introduce the idea of an extended Channel

102
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,727
Which means

103
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:44,287
The channel that you get when you use

104
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:51,455
End times in a row so for example if we're dealing with the binary symmetric Channel

105
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:54,527
You take and uses of it

106
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:58,623
And do not go yourself a channel whose possible input

107
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,975
Everything ranging from a string of n zeros

108
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,327
What was Arizona Juan

109
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:13,727
Lots of zeros 1:04 the way up to

110
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:17,311
So you got an input alphabet now size 2 to the n

111
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:24,735
For this example extended Channel output alphabet is the same set of strings in this case

112
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:27,551
Because they put up the binary symmetric Channel

113
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,111
The thing off of that

114
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,135
As the

115
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,671
Input

116
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,439
So

117
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,767
Hey.

118
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:41,631
If we take a binary symmetric Channel and redefined this new extended Channel

119
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:48,031
Each of these input can give cries and principal to any output at all but four Lodge and that will be

120
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,311
Typical set

121
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,079
Of

122
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,359
Outputs

123
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,223
Like this

124
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,783
So if you send all zeros

125
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:05,695
You can be fairly sure if any is very long that you'll end up getting an output that has about

126
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:08,767
And ones at FN flips

127
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:13,887
Plus or minus something fairly small that's going a square root event

128
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,215
That's a typical set for this particular input

129
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:20,031
So then put next door to it there's a typical fat

130
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,847
Which has a lot of overlap

131
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,895
So he is

132
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:30,271
The typical sat and every one of these has its typical set will have

133
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:33,855
It almost identical chemical set

134
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,671
End

135
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,487
In general for a general Channel

136
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,559
If you take all of these

137
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:45,375
Overlapping typical stats

138
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,751
And if you

139
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:57,407
Inputs to this extended Channel by using a probability distribution on the input

140
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:05,087
Of the type PX that we just been talking about when we Define the capacity so you pick each input

141
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:09,439
Symbol just from a distribution PX then

142
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:12,767
This collection of all the typical sets

143
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,815
That could come out here

144
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:18,655
Is going to have a size 2 to the end time to entropy of why

145
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:24,031
And the size of each of these typical sets

146
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:30,175
Will be about 2 to the end

147
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,991
Hrvy

148
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,015
Get an ex

149
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,343
Now cast your mind back

150
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,879
The noisy typewriter

151
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:45,279
Where did we got log9 bits from well we took the total number of typical

152
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:49,375
27 possible outputs 3/3 and we got nine

153
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:53,215
And that was how many known confusable inputs

154
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,311
Similarly here

155
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:02,431
We can take this extended Channel as long as that is really large

156
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:08,831
And we can imagine that we might be able to come up with a set of non confusable input

157
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,623
Do this extended Channel

158
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:15,231
And the number of known confusable

159
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:23,423
Inputs when I say non confusable I mean almost definitely

160
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:28,031
Long confusable inputs

161
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,567
Will be

162
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:34,943
The size of a typical set of outputs divided by the size of each of these Globes hat

163
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:39,295
CPN

164
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:42,879
Hrvy

165
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,415
Kevin X

166
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,767
Okay which is 2 to the end

167
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,839
X Mutual information

168
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:55,167
Which is h y - 8 Supply given X

169
00:12:56,447 --> 00:13:01,567
I'm sorry if I repeat this is a story we just told picking inputs at random

170
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:06,175
But using the optimal input distribution we will maximize this thing here

171
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:10,015
And in that case we will that established that we could get

172
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:14,879
Don't confuse will inputs whose size it is to to the end

173
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,415
* the capacity

174
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:23,583
Which means that each time you use the extended Channel which is an uses of the

175
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,119
Original Channel

176
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:30,751
We can communicate and see bits by picking one of those known confusable inputs

177
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,823
So you can send NC bit

178
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,407
And channel uses

179
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:46,623
QED and that's amazing that's amazing result this is not a proof it's just us to the plausibility argument

180
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:49,695
To help you understand why this might be possible

181
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,743
But we're not going to do

182
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:55,583
Is we're going to actually prove his theorem for the special case

183
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,375
Of the binary symmetric Channel

184
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,167
Yes question

185
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,127
Okay

186
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,711
In the case of the binary symmetric Channel

187
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:15,551
The actual size of this entire space here is 2 cm

188
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:22,975
In general or general Channel it could be as big as alphabets

189
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:26,047
Size to the end so for General Channel

190
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:32,447
If you got an alphabet size a why you take that and raise it the power and that's the entire

191
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:35,263
Size of the conceivable alphabet

192
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:40,895
But what I've been said was you pick the inputs from sum distribution PX

193
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:47,039
And that's up to you and when you do that you may find you're not using the full range of the output alphabet

194
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,855
Which may or may not be a good thing

195
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:56,255
So you got to choose PX not been determined which tip

196
00:14:56,511 --> 00:15:02,655
Optical input to using witch what your input sequence

197
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:09,055
That would mean you never send this one cuz you never said you'd be sending a typical small or over here

198
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:15,455
Unsimilar you'd never get half the channel or ones because that's very improbable to so it's possible if you want you could

199
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:21,855
Pick a probability distribution PX

200
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,135
Use the full outfit alphabet

201
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:30,047
For a symmetric Channel like this you're absolutely right when you do this optimization and he say how big can

202
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:36,447
Set of known confusable inputs make sure you got a nice uniform distribution

203
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,727
Very often the case

204
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,031
Okay

205
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,591
Any other questions

206
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,151
All right

207
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,015
Here is the proof

208
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:56,415
And will they cut them a bit more precise and I'll remind you what we already know about the binder symmetric

209
00:15:56,671 --> 00:16:01,535
Channel and then we will prove the theorem for the binary symmetric Channel

210
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,679
Okay

211
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:10,239
So let's write down a theorem

212
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:17,151
The theorem says

213
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:19,199
That

214
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:24,575
For the binary symmetric Channel

215
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,879
Coin flip probability

216
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,695
Ass

217
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,839
The general theorem is for any channel

218
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,399
But we're going to prove it for this particular case

219
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:41,983
Minus magic tunnel with a flip table

220
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,543
Who is capacity

221
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:51,967
Is equals 1 - 8

222
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:56,319
Now we're getting them statement

223
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,367
For any

224
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,671
Epsilon

225
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,463
No matter how small

226
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:05,279
As long as it's bigger than zero Epsilon

227
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,583
Looks on this diagram

228
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,727
And for any rate

229
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:18,591
As long as it's more than anywhere in this yellow region

230
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,383
On this diagram

231
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:28,319
You can pick him in the number of times you use the channel

232
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,671
Nevaeh put that is full on Jenna fan

233
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:37,791
Then you can make a code that will be this good

234
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:45,471
Islam and specificity login there exist

235
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,079
With that length

236
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,895
I'm with the rate

237
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:56,479
Big unrightful to the audit would be requested

238
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:59,551
And the Dakota forgot code

239
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,903
Such that

240
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,719
The probability

241
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,767
Look era

242
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:19,007
Is less than

243
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:22,079
The required value Epsilon

244
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,127
All right

245
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:30,783
I'm going to clean the board like you to turn to your neighbor and remind yourself what you know about the seven for having Co

246
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,343
Which we introduced in the first lecture

247
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:43,839
Okay

248
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:48,191
The 7th element code when we encountered it in lecture 1

249
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,495
Look like

250
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,055
This

251
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:56,383
Handling coding rule very sad

252
00:18:56,639 --> 00:19:02,783
The music gets to pick full bit switch everything hair S1 S2 S3

253
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:09,183
Then we use for constraints represented by the three constraints re

254
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:15,583
Represented by these three circles to set the remaining three of the seven transmitted bits

255
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,631
C5 C6

256
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,655
T7

257
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:22,751
Then we had a decoding rule that said

258
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:29,407
When you receive some receive bits you write them into this circle with three circles

259
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:35,807
You write and 127 into this diagram and you see

260
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:39,391
Which constraints are violated

261
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:46,815
Which is a positive so happy inside circles and then you use that syndrome to did you

262
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:50,399
The most probable explanation

263
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:58,847
Explanation being an account of which bits you think probably was flipped and then you can

264
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:02,431
Close ended 7 transmitted

265
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,223
It's probably what

266
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,503
Okay

267
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:08,063
So that was a 7 full hamming code

268
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,623
And it has the property that

269
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:15,743
If you flip any woman if the channel flips anyone bit then that bit can be

270
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:22,143
Era can be detected and corrected and we use that for the binary symmetric Channel

271
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:25,727
To take the rate down from wall

272
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,823
Venera probe self

273
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:34,175
Down to something that was more of order at squared

274
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:36,479
Since I was 7 full having code

275
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,575
What's the code to the race of 4/7 from one

276
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:46,207
And it had a small lateral probability examples of a block code

277
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:51,839
Now I'm the screen I'm showing you another way of defining is having for having code its

278
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:58,495
The same code but I'm showing you the three constraints by matrix and it has cooled the party check

279
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,031
Matrix

280
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:04,639
The idea is

281
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:10,015
That for any linear code you can Define the set of constraints

282
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:15,135
Buy a set of rows each constraint we will have three here three circles

283
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:15,903
Each

284
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:19,232
Constraint is defined by a row of The Matrix

285
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:25,888
Valley transmission satisfy this equation H * T where T is the transmission is equal to 0

286
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:32,288
That means that the top constraint gives you 0 second gives you there

287
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:38,688
Ones are in this Matrix is identifying which bits are in which Circle so this is the first Circle hair

288
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:42,272
This is the second misses the first

289
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,552
And

290
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:49,952
Circle one contains bits 123 and 5 which is why the Matrix goes 1 1 1 0

291
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,488
00

292
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,048
Okay

293
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,352
Circle 2

294
00:21:56,608 --> 00:22:01,472
Has 2 3/4 and 6 so put the wanting comes 2 3 4 and 6

295
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,544
And the food Circle

296
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:09,920
134 + 78347

297
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,224
And

298
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:19,136
Because this particular code has the property that every one of the constraints is just

299
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:25,536
Moon dangling extra power keep it sitting in it you have As Nice simple property

300
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:30,656
Inside this Matrix the identity Matrix looking

301
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:38,080
And that makes the code very easy to encode you just slap in whatever values want for the

302
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:44,480
Best full bit then you can read out what these bits need to be set at 2 but in general you can make codes

303
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:50,880
You don't have a simple identity Matrix taking that coding a bit more difficult

304
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:55,744
But you can imagine codes that we don't have this nice simplification

305
00:22:56,256 --> 00:23:02,400
Nevertheless you could come up with an encoding rules that use assets some number of bits k

306
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,960
Which hair is for

307
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:11,360
And then the total transmission of n Bits hair 7 is that in such a way

308
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,152
About these constraints off at the time

309
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:19,808
All right so that's the general way of describing and coding list of constraints that must be satisfied

310
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:23,648
Facenda set some of the bits the constraints determine the other bits

311
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,440
Then you receive

312
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:32,352
I received the factor which was thinking of us being t+ and when I + I mean mug

313
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:34,400
So didn't bitwise addition

314
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,680
What do you like to

315
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:42,592
We compute the syndrome which is which circles a happy and which are sad by x h x

316
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:45,664
That's cool that that is a name for the syndrome

317
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,712
8 * I

318
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:54,112
Will an example example let's say that we flip

319
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:56,928
Bit number

320
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,208
All right

321
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:04,608
Then whatever we transmit the way the sender is going to come out this is h x

322
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,656
T+

323
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:10,240
And that equals 8 * 2 + 8 * n

324
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:15,360
Which is just eight times and because whatever we chose to transmit satisfied

325
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:21,760
Hate something so we lose EHT molest of the syndrome that just depends on which

326
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,552
Cheap Fitbit

327
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:29,952
Then the transmission for example might have b0100

328
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:38,400
Transmission received my 2001

329
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:43,264
There is there is there a n f u x h x that thing

330
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,080
Written as a column vector

331
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:49,920
Then it'll spit out Wong Wong Sera

332
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,016
Which is

333
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,600
The three you find in the second column across

334
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:58,880
All right

335
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:05,280
And by looking at the syndrome you can say which of these columns possibly could be an explanation for the syndrome when you noticed

336
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:15,520
Right that's how easy syndrome decoding is in the Sky City just looking to Matrix suicide what is the one called him

337
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:17,824
That could have been explained this

338
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,128
In general

339
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:26,528
It's the noise has flipped more than one of its maybe a heart attacks to do syndrome decoding you got some

340
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:32,928
Received you hit with h and you got his ass and now the task is to say

341
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:39,328
That's a 10 I wonder what noise the noise was itself is actually an NP complete problems

342
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:41,632
But we're going to assume that we can

343
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,680
So that's not a problem

344
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:47,264
And come up with a guess all fan

345
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,056
Bazooka Lenhart

346
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:55,456
That's the job of the syndrome Dakota that you give it a syndrome comes up with the most probable explanation the smallest

347
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:57,504
Wait noise vaxxer

348
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,808
The accounts of syndrome

349
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:04,672
Okay so that's how the 74 hamming code works and

350
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,560
The way I've described it leaves itself very nicely to a generalization namely

351
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,096
Full big Iran

352
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:19,008
And for any code rate of your interested in you can't imagine making a much bigger Matrix h

353
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:22,336
So you can make with

354
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:26,432
And could be enormous

355
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,968
Nmroads

356
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:30,784
And

357
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,000
If we find K2 B N - M

358
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:41,792
Then

359
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:44,608
This set of constraints the Weaver sundown

360
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:51,008
Probably defines a code with a rate something along the lines of is k / n

361
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:57,664
It may not be exactly this right because if the constraints YouVersion down rst redundant constraint twice

362
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:04,064
Then it doesn't count you'll just subtract off one row that you haven't

363
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,880
Imply each other then this is the right of your coat

364
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:14,048
So if not describe for you the entire field of coding theory for binary channels the task adjust

365
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:16,352
To come up with architect Matrix

366
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:19,424
And you'll need a Dakota that consoled this

367
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,704
Problem here

368
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:27,104
And the accession of Shannon's noisy Channel coding theorem is no Mountain House movie

369
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:33,504
No matter how close the races to beer you can actually find a Linea

370
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:38,112
Have to do anything fancy and you can define a party check Matrix h

371
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:44,512
That will get you places you like to the capacity and it can have an error probability

372
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:47,584
As small as you like as long as we get to choose N&M

373
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,864
Sufficiently

374
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,888
Lodge

375
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:52,960
So that's what we are now going to prove

376
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:59,360
I'm going to prove it with the help of something that we had a few weeks ago remember when

377
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:02,176
Show me proof that data compression responsible

378
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,712
We sent you off

379
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:06,272
The lottery ticket office

380
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:08,064
And your task was to buy

381
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:14,464
The smallest number of lottery tickets for the bent coin Lottery such that you could guarantee that you were going to

382
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,512
The win the bent coin Lottery

383
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:25,216
We sold this by thinking about typical sets and you came home with a very large dusting bag full of

384
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,104
On the front of every ticket was a string of zeros and ones of length n

385
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,968
And all the tickets had roughly

386
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:37,760
A fraction F1

387
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:44,672
So the number of tickets that you bought all the typical tickets and the number of those we worked

388
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:48,512
What's 2 ^ enzymes the Bunny Ranch

389
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,816
Plus a little bit to do with square root of n

390
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,376
Which is small compared to end

391
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:57,472
So that was how many tickets you had in your very big fat

392
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:03,360
I'm not going to make use of those tickets to prove the noisy Channel coding theorem

393
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,384
As well

394
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,784
And you can imagine this working

395
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,320
In two ways

396
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:17,184
If I tell you the theorem that there exists a good code

397
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:23,840
The standard way of proving such a theorem is then to describe how to make that good code so I tell you what

398
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:30,240
That phone is required what is it

399
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:35,616
To make good symbol codes

400
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:42,528
So I'll give you an excellent and it would be nice if I could just give you and you will make

401
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:49,952
Which has the property that its rate is

402
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:55,328
Bigger than or equal to it and it's our probability

403
00:29:55,584 --> 00:30:01,728
That would be cold a constructive proof and polite and civil society that if you

404
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:04,800
You say something is true but it's true

405
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:11,200
I'm over now going to do is a rather outrageous thing which is we're going to have a non-constructive proof I'm going to show you the

406
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:17,600
This is true that there exists

407
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:24,000
But it looks like this let's have an analogy set in Iraq so let's say some Skeptics about

408
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:30,400
At World diplomacy say that Ashley in spite of all magnificent invented interventions in Iraq

409
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,424
Exist

410
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:35,264
A malnourished child in Iraq which we decide

411
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:42,944
And one way to do that is the constructive method that you identified a child whose weight is less than a kilogram

412
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:49,344
The definition of identify

413
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,648
Unless the street they live on

414
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:56,512
But Shannon's method is not chica he got his all the children in Iraq

415
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:59,072
Absolutely all of the mini weighing machine

416
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:00,096
Waze

417
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:03,424
All of them simultaneously and find the total weight

418
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:07,008
Permit you can deduce the average weight of all the children in Iraq

419
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:10,080
And if that average weight is less than 1 kilogram

420
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,104
Then

421
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:17,504
That establishes a positive way that must be at least one baby with weight loss

422
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,320
Almost all of them

423
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,856
At least half of them

424
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,136
Must be malnourished

425
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:27,744
Without ever identify any particular one of them rushed

426
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:33,888
And that's the way we're going to prove Santa's naughty teleporting through I'm not going to tell you

427
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:40,288
A particular way of making the partnership Matrix what we're going to do is a great big average overall party checkmate

428
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:46,688
I will say what is the average Premier Humira of all of these

429
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:48,224
Easiest answer that question

430
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,272
Identify one good coat

431
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:55,136
Will find that we can make the average probability of all the codes

432
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,416
Tiny

433
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,952
We can make this more as we like

434
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:01,024
Bethel there exist

435
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:07,936
Potassium actually making a good code is left as an exercise for the Rita and that what coding theory is all about

436
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:12,288
Another filled with Decades of work now under its belt

437
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:20,224
Okay so that's the plan of campaign we're going to use our lottery tickets

438
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:20,992
We're going to

439
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:27,648
Use them in conjunction with the set of all conceivable partnership matrices and we will prove the theorem

440
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,976
On the therm Hair Says

441
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:37,376
It said before

442
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:42,240
Reliable communication what's next

443
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,288
We will

444
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:50,688
Take a linear block code so we will pick a particular party techmatrix H which will actually end up pic

445
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:53,760
Looking at random will imagine that we have chosen that

446
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:56,320
We can then Define eye syndrome Dakota

447
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,600
Using

448
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:59,392
That particular code

449
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:03,488
Ascendant Dakota is not going to solve

450
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,256
This

451
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:07,584
Problem perfectly without going to find the most probable end

452
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,144
I'm going to the fine for you

453
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,472
Dakota based on the syndrome which is going to be good enough

454
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:14,752
And then

455
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:17,056
Having done that we will have defined

456
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:20,640
An encoder and decoder for that particular code

457
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:26,784
And then we're going to average overall coats and find what the average probability of era is

458
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,576
Just check what my next

459
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:32,160
Slightest so this is what we're going to do

460
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,768
Imagine that we have chosen a block length and

461
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:42,400
Will adjust that later on if need be to make it even larger then

462
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:49,056
We have gone to the bank coin Lottery and we won the bank Coin Laundry by buying a sufficiently large number of tickets in a roll in the back

463
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:51,104
Anderol to the nh2 of f

464
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,456
We not take all of those tickets

465
00:33:55,712 --> 00:34:01,856
And instead of doing what we did a few weeks ago which was roseto we want to be systematic and right little short names on the river

466
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:04,928
And use that

467
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:05,696
Space

468
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:10,304
For the English or object namely we're going to write down syndrome

469
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,096
Of that noise vector

470
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,376
Which is on the front

471
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:20,288
We're going to write down it's syndrome using the package check Matrix age that we've just chosen another reverse

472
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:24,128
Write down the syndrome syndrome is h x n

473
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,664
And that's

474
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:27,968
Adult Jackfruit length is m

475
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:29,760
It's okay

476
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,576
So you take every ticket

477
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:35,136
On the front is not a possible noise actor

478
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:41,536
An SS is the flip right of the Channel with dealing with her that's what I'm assuming then you can be

479
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,072
That

480
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,352
Uo

481
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:51,008
The ticket but is going to have today's No Electronic when we use the channel and times in succession

482
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:56,896
The winning tickets every single ticket you write on the reverse of that ticket Walt the syndrome would be

483
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,176
Of the noise Factor

484
00:34:58,944 --> 00:34:59,456
Okay

485
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:05,088
17 drive me just computed by multiplying h x no.2

486
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,416
Then

487
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,232
Then what we going to do

488
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,256
Is

489
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:18,656
Encode in the standard way the standard way of encoding is you let

490
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:20,192
The user

491
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:22,240
Set K of the bits

492
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:25,824
Then you set the remaining mbits

493
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:36,064
So the transmission we can think of a few MC to T3 up to TK

494
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,368
Which might not be in this order

495
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:45,024
But transmitted bit set by the user

496
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:51,168
Then the remaining ones TK plus one or the end

497
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:53,472
By using linear algebra

498
00:35:55,008 --> 00:36:01,152
To figure out what value these guys need to have in order that all of these constraints h x t equals zero

499
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,688
Are indeed satisfied

500
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:09,856
All right but I think Cody and we send it over the Tamil we got the receipt Factory Witch

501
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:10,624
Is

502
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,208
Transmission plus noise syndrome

503
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:18,304
Which is 8 something

504
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:24,960
Then we reach into the big nothing back for the tickets we look at the back of all of them until we find one

505
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:25,984
Syndrome on it

506
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:30,336
Or maybe we find several that have that syndrome on it

507
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:36,224
Hopefully does anyone know which is all gas

508
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:38,784
That's not decoding method

509
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,832
This approach

510
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:43,648
Could fail in a couple of ways

511
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:50,304
It could be that we don't actually own the ticket that has the correct noise Vector on it

512
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:52,352
That possible

513
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:58,752
But it's very unlikely because we've already bought enough tickets have a 99.999999

514
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,800
9% chance of winning the lottery

515
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:06,944
Why we put enough nines into that 99.9 to get along

516
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:10,272
It's going to be so we're going to hit at salon

517
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,552
So

518
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,112
The probability of error

519
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:24,608
The probability of stalia is a sum of two possibilities as we might actually have the winning ticket

520
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,424
The one that has the correct noisette dramas

521
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,752
The other possibility is

522
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:37,152
We have got the winning ticket but was another ticket in the bet in the bag so we don't actually know

523
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:39,200
Which noise that just happened

524
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:44,576
So the Progressive Era is equal to the sum of two times

525
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:53,024
Uncle P Wong

526
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:56,096
Mp2

527
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:58,912
P1 is the probability

528
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,704
That

529
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:06,336
And is not in the bank

530
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:13,760
This is the Progressive Era of the entire and coding and CPT coding system is defined using a particular Matrix

531
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:15,040
H

532
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,320
Orvis

533
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,112
Code

534
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:21,440
With architect Matrix

535
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:24,512
H2O is the probability that depends on age

536
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:28,096
The first time is the Pro Bowl

537
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:34,752
I actually don't depend on the bag we just bought there's nothing to do with h when we both all those tickets

538
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:37,056
The best time is actually

539
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,848
Independence

540
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,248
The P2 is the other possibility explanation

541
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:50,368
And that says what I am is in the bag

542
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,696
But

543
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,560
And poodles

544
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:01,632
M&T Bank

545
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:04,448
Oops

546
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,776
I also in the bag

547
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:13,152
That satisfy h x and twiddle is equal to that

548
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:19,808
Or if you like eight times the difference between and and and twiddled is 0

549
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:31,840
Habitat Community but to see if you understanding me so far this is the most

550
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:19,712
Okay are there any questions about the

551
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:23,296
Commissions to the Progressive Era

552
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,088
Kevin on board

553
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:29,952
Okay so we can say the fan is not in the bag

554
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:33,536
That we can make the probability of that as small as we like

555
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:34,816
By picking

556
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:39,168
And Lodge

557
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:46,592
I'm being careful with this thing that I'm so fudging a little bit which is the size of a typical fats which is Tuesday and

558
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:48,128
H2 of f

559
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:57,344
That will come back to that. Fudge laundromat Edinburg we can make this place so small in the right sense

560
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,416
The first time is dealt with just by making an enormous

561
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:07,328
The second time is much more exciting this is the one that actually depends on eggs because if I picked some

562
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:14,752
The lights for example one with all the rows identical then maybe it's much more likely that you'll have identical syndrome

563
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:21,152
You can imagine all sorts of ways in which an H could be bad it is very easy to make vodka

564
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:26,528
Okay so let's write down the second time

565
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:30,112
That'll definition of it

566
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:32,160
P 2 of 8 is

567
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:35,232
It's a sum over all possible noise that cuz

568
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:39,072
Subject to them being in the bag

569
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,656
That we bought

570
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:49,056
Let Me Wait by the probability of that happening

571
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:52,128
I think that counts

572
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,151
Warm

573
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:55,455
If there's another End Portal in the bag

574
00:41:55,711 --> 00:42:01,855
And 0 if not I'll give us the Progressive Era

575
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:05,695
Is warm if the thing in Brackets is true and it's zero otherwise

576
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:09,279
If there existed and twiddle

577
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:10,815
Such that

578
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:12,863
Anvil is not the same as an

579
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:15,935
And twiddle is in the bag

580
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:21,055
+ 8 * + - + twiddle

581
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,335
Is there a

582
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:28,991
So this is the function which is warm if the number of clashes that we've got

583
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:33,087
Illinois Vector that actually happens is bigger than or equal to one

584
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:42,815
Okay if and twiddle the question was why does it matter event riddles in the back

585
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:49,471
We only have a problem if when we're reaching into the bag and look at the back of each other

586
00:42:56,127 --> 00:43:01,247
Because we found two noise that gives it a different from each other

587
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:03,807
So it has to be in the bag

588
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,343
Takoda's trouble

589
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:08,671
I think because then we don't know what that is

590
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,975
The Assumption we're going to be biting

591
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:13,791
Is

592
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:14,815
That

593
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:18,911
Yeah the way the Dakota what is if you find the Cinderella on the back

594
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:20,959
Then

595
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:24,543
Retarded iPhone

596
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:28,639
Exactly one ticket that has a tender lump on the back

597
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:35,039
That will fail if we haven't got the right noise if we have got the right one in the bag

598
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:38,367
Another one in the back with the same syndrome

599
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:40,159
Okay

600
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:50,655
All right this is slightly coming proof maybe because it's using this notion of a syndrome Dakota

601
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:57,055
Maybe not

602
00:43:57,311 --> 00:44:00,895
In the book which is the preferred general channels and you can look at that you

603
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:02,943
Right

604
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:08,063
This proposition is saying but the number of classes is bigger or equal to one

605
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:10,879
If you think about that

606
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,159
Function

607
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:16,255
That is a function which other function of the number of classes

608
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:18,815
Stop being

609
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:20,095
0

610
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:24,959
And then increases when you hit warm to the body of warm and then it remains

611
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:25,983
Guam

612
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:29,823
How many classes are all screwed

613
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:34,687
Which means we got to Wong out of this expression so the function with that

614
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:38,783
As a function of the number of classes it looks like this

615
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,599
How's the property

616
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:44,415
Vantage is less than or equal to

617
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:48,511
Which is the number of flashes

618
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:52,351
Okay so in yellow off showing the number of classes

619
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,423
In white

620
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:58,239
We have the function

621
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,591
Number flashes

622
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:05,407
It's raining right now

623
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:11,551
Why am I leaving this I want you to be clear that the other function is bigger than the white function

624
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:16,159
Nah

625
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:20,767
What should we do next

626
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:27,679
Let's

627
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:30,239
Use an inequality

628
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:33,567
And

629
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:40,991
Let's do a bit of redefining

630
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,879
But I'll rewrite this as

631
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:50,463
Awesome a proposition which is going to be the yellow lot

632
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:54,303
So now let's do Daniela

633
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,839
I'm going to add up

634
00:45:57,375 --> 00:46:00,447
The some overall and riddles

635
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:03,519
But I'm not able to the noise active it actually happened

636
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:07,615
Subject to the constraints and twiddle is in the bag

637
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:09,407
I'm going to ask

638
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:11,455
Hello is the end riddle

639
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:16,831
Is your syndrome the same as the syndrome

640
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:18,623
Which is

641
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:21,183
The function h m i n Central

642
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:23,231
Is equal to 0

643
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:29,119
All right so I've relaxed this thing I've made it bigger

644
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:35,007
I'm not saying a piece of its smaller than its functioning as long as I can

645
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:37,567
Then I've also established his time

646
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:43,967
That's why I was staring I'm trying to manipulate P2 into a form where we can say I have if I do this

647
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:45,503
I can make it tiny

648
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:47,807
Power

649
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:51,391
Just fine

650
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,463
Yes

651
00:46:54,719 --> 00:47:00,863
So this is the number of any twiddle to clash with me is the number of them because I'm not coming over oil and twiddles

652
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:07,263
All right Services looking at every single one of them and has an enormous number

653
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:10,591
Place the simple comes to hair which is either 0 or 1

654
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:16,991
Buy a sum of two to the NH avesta a trillion times

655
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:23,391
If any of the match will get someone

656
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:25,951
So we just this relaxation

657
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:27,999
No

658
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:32,607
The next thing we're going to do

659
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:36,959
We made a little bit of progress we've simplified this a little b****

660
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:39,519
And still got an H dependents in it

661
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:46,175
What we end up we want to end up showing is that we can make this very small

662
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:52,831
And it's going to be difficult to do that with any particular right so get the average overall H's and show that the average

663
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:53,599
P2

664
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:55,135
Is very small

665
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:59,743
So when I get to look at average of P2

666
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:03,327
I'm going to average over

667
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:09,727
Ohsi when I say average overall they just I just mean literally take the set of all possible binary Pirates check

668
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:16,127
Matrices and pick completely independently around so every 0 or 1

669
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:17,663
Is 0 warm

670
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:19,199
Photography 50/50

671
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:20,223
Right

672
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:25,087
Suck the average ability to choose is the some overall h

673
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:27,647
Pfh

674
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:31,743
Somerville and

675
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:33,023
In the bag

676
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,839
See you then

677
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:39,679
Some event rental in the back

678
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:43,519
And with a lot equal to end

679
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:47,615
No justice no P event Ritalin half the recipe of n

680
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:48,639
It's just

681
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:50,687
How they act is working

682
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:52,991
And we have Wong

683
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:54,271
4

684
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:58,879
Types of ax equals there I would have to find a new thing

685
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:01,183
X is defined to be

686
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,975
+ - Central

687
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:11,423
All right

688
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,447
No

689
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:15,519
Let's reorder the summations little bit

690
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:19,359
We'll take the song over and in some of the French poodle

691
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:21,407
Outside and put some of H

692
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,687
On the inside

693
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:26,527
So have a sum of and

694
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:29,855
In the bag

695
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:33,439
Okay then

696
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:37,023
Summer Event riddle

697
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:39,071
In the bag

698
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:40,607
But not the same as an

699
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:49,567
Some / h h

700
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:51,359
Wang

701
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:55,199
If 8 * x equal 0

702
00:49:56,991 --> 00:50:00,831
Inside by definition the difference between an event rental

703
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,367
All right

704
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:04,415
There was something overall

705
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:05,951
Typical noise actors

706
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:10,559
Waited by the overall typical noise that doesn't riddle

707
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:18,239
And then we look at the question if you take the difference between nose and hit it with the Matrix h

708
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:20,287
What's the probability

709
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:26,175
Averaging over old matrices age that you will get zero that's the meaning of this time in hat

710
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:30,015
Suck to answer that question

711
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:35,391
This thing here

712
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,415
Is

713
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:39,999
The probability that

714
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:46,655
Is it all given a particular f8x now would give an ax because once defined

715
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:50,239
And in this some event rental in this song we've got hostiles next

716
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:54,335
Now hair this is the probability for that given X

717
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:56,383
The probability that

718
00:50:56,639 --> 00:51:02,783
The first row of the Matrix x x is equal to 0 times the second row of the

719
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:06,367
Is there a drug

720
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:12,767
Is Matrix x x is equal to 0 where H is this randomly-chosen Matrix who's Rosario

721
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:13,791
Guam

722
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:15,839
H2

723
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:17,631
Kh3

724
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:22,751
Dot-dot-dot on all of those accession

725
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:27,871
Texting a little Sideshow which is the exercise where we understand this problem

726
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:30,687
Forget everything you just been doing

727
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:34,015
I'm think about this extremely simple mathematical question

728
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:38,111
If I give you a fixed back to X which is non zero

729
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:46,047
It's nonzero because in fact is the difference between two noise actors and that's all different from each other

730
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:49,631
So that makes it non zero if I give you a fixed

731
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:53,215
Back to act which is non-binary in the spotlight stand

732
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:57,567
And then if I bring along a single row of this Matrix

733
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:03,455
Just one road and if I call it element H1 H2 H3 H4

734
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:05,759
What's the probability

735
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:07,807
The end of product between h

736
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:08,831
FedEx

737
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:10,111
Is there a

738
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:12,415
Habitat

739
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:13,695
Your neighbor

740
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:33,407
If it helps think about just this special case have it on the board with

741
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:34,687
Back to the blanks

742
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:42,623
Okay

743
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:44,671
The question is

744
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:49,535
What's the probability that one row of this Matrix

745
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:51,071
X x

746
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:52,607
Give zero

747
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:53,631
Would you like to

748
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:55,167
Any thoughts

749
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:02,079
Lockpicking the H's

750
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:04,895
Completely at random by flipping a Fair coin

751
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:09,503
Exit to fix Vector which has zeros in some places

752
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:12,319
And it's got some ones in other places

753
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:14,879
China special case here

754
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:16,671
The value

755
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:23,071
8 shot X is actually equal ch2

756
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:23,839
Lights for

757
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:25,631
Modulo 2

758
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:29,215
So let me ask the question another way if I take 3

759
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:31,007
Coins

760
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:34,591
And I say we're going to get her number

761
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:40,991
Which is either going to be all don't even I'm going to get it by adding up the outcomes of the coin tosses in the coin says what

762
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:42,527
On one side and 0 on the other

763
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:45,599
The question is if I add up

764
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:48,927
The number of ones and find out if it's old or even

765
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:53,023
If each of those coins is 50/50

766
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:57,375
If I add up all three of them what's the probability I got

767
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:58,911
An odd number

768
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:01,215
Okay yeah

769
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:02,751
It's 50/50

770
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:05,311
Does that depend on how many coins I had it up

771
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:06,591
No

772
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:12,991
Because I was just one of them or even if I give you any number whether it's a little

773
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:18,367
And now I flip another coin and I had that number is still 50/50

774
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:19,903
Okay

775
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:22,207
So the answer is

776
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:26,815
The probability that the top row x x gives you 0

777
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:30,399
Is a Hof

778
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:32,703
Not true

779
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:34,495
Feniex

780
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:40,639
So now the problem is that

781
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:44,479
All of these assertions are true the probability that you

782
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:49,343
When you go to give an act which is the difference between two noise that does as it happens

783
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:52,671
Okay that's the answer to question 1

784
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:55,231
Now the question is if I

785
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:57,279
Take a fixed X

786
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:03,935
Just as the 400m rows of this Matrix and I make them independently

787
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:05,471
By tossing coins

788
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:11,615
What's the probability of the first red contacts

789
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:12,895
Etc

790
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:17,247
How to talk to you later

791
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:34,655
Access fixed

792
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:39,263
I flip coins to seven letter that comes out or even

793
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:42,847
I'm a flip coin 7 comes out all the raven

794
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:44,639
It's 50-50 whether total revenue

795
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:51,807
How to flip coins for the next one Federal independent of each other so the probability even

796
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:53,599
Everything is

797
00:55:58,463 --> 00:55:59,743
Hoffa Poweramp

798
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:05,631
Anyone think an alternative answer is 3

799
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:07,423
No

800
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:10,495
Anyone

801
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:14,079
I don't want to sleep or shy

802
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:15,359
Okay

803
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:16,895
So this is the correct answer

804
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:20,991
So we made a little progress cuz suddenly this is all disappeared

805
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,039
But it's just half the power and

806
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:29,183
And vanishes so up the next slide okay we don't want that

807
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:37,887
Average of p205h averaging overall h

808
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:38,911
Is

809
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:42,495
The song over the o n in the bag

810
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:44,543
Wasted by Pia van

811
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:47,615
Some overall length twiddle

812
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,663
Leather in the bag

813
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:54,271
And the time not the same as an

814
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,647
Then we do the Salvation / h

815
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:05,023
Listen time quantity half we just argued is off to the power 10

816
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:08,351
Which is the number

817
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:12,447
With no dependents

818
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:16,031
I just don't know Independence and interdependence either

819
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:22,431
Because it depends on X and the answer to that question we just answering didn't depend on X1

820
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:23,967
Just got out of the number

821
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:26,015
And the number is 1/2 of the m

822
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:27,039
X

823
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:29,343
The number of individuals that are in the bag

824
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:32,159
Left

825
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:34,719
Averaged

826
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:37,279
Over the distribution

827
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:39,583
And this thing doesn't have any dependents on an

828
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:45,983
So we can just say the some overall line in the bag will a maximum one isn't it

829
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:48,287
Time

830
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:54,943
The number things in the bag let's round up that -1 and say I was to to be to the end times entropy

831
00:57:55,199 --> 00:58:00,063
Tuesday nh-27 size of a typical set

832
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:01,599
Little bit

833
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:03,903
That's the number things in the back

834
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:08,255
And then that multiplies aha

835
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:10,047
How to power amp

836
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:14,655
What are we done reviews Shannon's malnutrition detection scheme

837
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:19,519
To establish that if you average over absolutely all linear codes

838
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:21,823
The average performance of those codes

839
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:26,431
The probability of Mara if you use a slightly deranged syndrome Dakota with the lodge

840
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:28,223
I've been back for the tickets

841
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:30,271
The probability of error

842
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:31,551
Is

843
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:34,367
Progressive Era

844
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:40,255
Is lesser April therapy one which we can make tiny

845
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:46,399
Plus this all the time what you're coming this Saturday make time it depends on what nhu of F&M

846
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:48,703
Sorry

847
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:50,239
To the power

848
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:54,591
Let's put it downstairs so it'll be clear

849
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:59,711
What tiny looks like the one over

850
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:01,247
2 to the

851
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:02,783
Minus

852
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:04,831
And

853
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:07,647
H2off what's a little bit

854
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:14,047
Okay

855
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:16,863
I miss talking to him here

856
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:24,287
This time can be made arbitrarily small if well it vanishes is

857
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:30,431
Is much bigger than nh2 Avast

858
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:35,039
Rearranging that says if I move in

859
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:38,879
Is bigger than 8 to advance

860
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:42,207
Or rearranging again into terms

861
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:43,999
That we do like

862
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:46,047
1 - M / n

863
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:48,351
Is less than

864
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:51,679
One- H2O

865
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:55,007
I just run out of boards because that

866
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:56,031
It's saying

867
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:59,359
But this second time here vanishes

868
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:02,431
The right

869
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:03,967
His last

870
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:05,503
Van

871
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:07,039
The capacity

872
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:12,159
Guess the race

873
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:19,071
Is what channel this particular channel is 1 -

874
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:22,399
H2O

875
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:28,799
Thus we have proved noisy Channel coding for the binary symmetric Channel

876
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:29,823
Of s

877
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:32,895
And we did it by using sing Dustin bag

878
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:36,991
How do we already used to prove the source heading to proofs

879
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:38,271
The price of love

880
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:47,231
Are there any questions

881
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:52,607
American have questions about everything we've done in the first

882
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:54,399
Electra yes

883
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:03,871
Okay

884
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:05,407
So

885
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:07,711
Right

886
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:09,759
So the question is

887
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:12,319
What was this step from here

888
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:13,087
2 hair

889
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:20,511
Yeah alright why is it bigger. Hopefully that's going to be easy let's just make clear what we're doing here

890
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:24,095
At this point we were saying

891
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:28,191
I'm worried about the possibility this annoys back to Mike come along

892
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:29,471
Such that

893
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:32,799
There is another noise that cat in the bag with the same syndrome

894
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:35,103
On the probability of era

895
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:36,895
Is the probability

896
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:37,663
That

897
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:41,247
The number of such classes is he the one or two or three or four

898
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:48,159
That's a very complicated proposition to deal with if I tell you I want to know the probability that the number of classes

899
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:50,719
This is either one or two or three or four

900
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:53,535
And I don't care whether it's one or two or three or four

901
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:57,119
It turns out to be much much easier to say

902
01:01:57,887 --> 01:02:02,239
Take this ticket out of the bag I want to know what the probability of clashing with this ticket

903
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:05,311
Then after that the provision flashing with this one

904
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:11,711
Then add the prophetic blessing with this one so I take every single ticket and separately book how was the probability of a classroom

905
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:12,479
Central

906
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:14,271
Then at all of those up

907
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:18,111
I'm not much easier because I answer a question about just

908
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:22,719
The original end and the end twiddle on this ticket that's much easier thing

909
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:26,815
Astrakhan we could answer that question then at least we could do the averaging

910
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:27,583
Easily

911
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:30,911
If we do that if we say what's the probability of a class with this one

912
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:37,311
And what's wrong with you besides for this and if we then add all those up Ashley over counting the probability of era

913
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:43,711
Because errors which may be rare is will occur when there is a clash Nick could be the Clash

914
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:44,991
Clumps

915
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:46,783
The wind there was a Clash

916
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:49,855
Revista Cara's

917
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:52,927
I'm so adding up the probability

918
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:58,303
Old individual crashes and adding those together gives you over estimate

919
01:02:58,559 --> 01:02:59,839
Of the probability of era

920
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:02,143
Because you got only one IRA

921
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:05,215
When does the big car crash of clashing with each other

922
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:07,775
So we deliberately overestimating

923
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:09,567
The true probability of Ira

924
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:10,335
Bye

925
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:13,663
Taking a simpler thing to compute

926
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:20,319
Does a standard name for this cuz I forgot to note the type of mathematical operation we doing Harris

927
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:25,695
Union bound OK Google the union bound

928
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:27,231
All right

929
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:31,327
So you got a load of different possibilities that you're worried about

930
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:35,679
And if any of them happens it's bad news what's the probability of bad news happening

931
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:39,007
Well we're going to work out the probability of bad things happening

932
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:45,151
Then workout has a bad thing to them what kind of problems can Bad Thing 3 happening together

933
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:51,551
That will actually overestimate the true probability of a bad thing happening

934
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:54,879
That's the meaning of this inequality

935
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:57,695
Any other questions

936
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:01,535
It's a union that

937
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:04,351
But any questions about this proof

938
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:07,423
Any questions about

939
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:08,959
Let's just want to 8

940
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:13,567
Because we're now essentially done with information Theory

941
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:17,151
Not told you the whole of information Theory compression bit

942
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:19,199
Where's on the noisy Channel coding bit

943
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:21,759
That's all there any questions about

944
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:24,831
Great depression when was Utah County

945
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:43,007
Okay

946
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:05,023
Okay so the question is how do these tickets relate to pay which of

947
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:11,423
The sender and am which is the number of constraints the number of constrained

948
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:14,495
Find a code that way using

949
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:18,847
The tickets that we bought

950
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:23,455
Hypotheses written on them

951
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:25,759
Of what the noise vaxxine might be

952
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:30,879
And they all have the property that they got lots of zeros in a small number of 1

953
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:35,999
Because we know by typicality

954
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:42,911
That it's very likely that the actual number ones will be a Bath & F bus line

955
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:45,215
Flatter yourself

956
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:52,383
Find some little X Alpha to ensure that 99.9999%

957
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:55,199
Probability that the number of Long's

958
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:58,527
Looks like that

959
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:04,415
How does this relate to the sender is choosing to send

960
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:11,327
Well it's completely unrelated cuz he's noise actors added to the transmission

961
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:13,119
To the transmission itself

962
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:16,191
House just the same length

963
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:22,335
That will be a subset of those bits which conventionally often sits at the left hand side but don't have to

964
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:23,871
I'll be a subset of them

965
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:25,407
Numbering k

966
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:31,807
Which are set by the user so he's will be so that's one S2 S3 up to SK

967
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:36,671
And then the remaining ones will be sent by the constraints

968
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:39,743
Shelby these end of a bit

969
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:45,887
Tek plus one up to TN by the constraints

970
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:48,447
This is what we send it has

971
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:54,847
Nothing to do with the noise that goes it won't look like any of them it's very likely to be a dentist

972
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:59,967
These ones are very likely to look down as well

973
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:05,087
So that's what gets transmitted what's been received is the sum of these two

974
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:11,999
Then we hit that with the syndrome operation which is HJ bring on h u attacked people ascend

975
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:15,583
Which is received manga

976
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:18,399
Give you then

977
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:19,935
That value is that

978
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:22,495
Is 8 * 2 + 8 * n

979
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:25,567
Which is 8 times n

980
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:27,615
Which is completely independent of t

981
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:34,271
So yes the user was able to choose K if a bit since that them and then the constraints will use them

982
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:37,087
But the syndrome doesn't depend a******

983
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:39,647
It's completely independent

984
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:45,023
Whether we will achieve successful communication on this particular the use of the channel

985
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:50,143
Will depend on what end is because our success will be

986
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:54,751
Determined by the syndrome Dakota being able to identify and or not

987
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:58,079
Whether we succeed or not depends on

988
01:07:58,335 --> 01:08:04,479
The center of Dakota identifying and that has nothing to do with T is completely independent

989
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:07,807
712 Harmon Cove we have the property that if you flip a bit

990
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:09,087
Then

991
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:12,671
You can detect that flip bit and it doesn't matter what the source

992
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:14,207
Choice Watson

993
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:15,743
Okay

994
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:20,863
So the 7 full having code is the analogy to use have to understand why

995
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:22,655
T doesn't matter at all

996
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:25,471
If we succeed

997
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:31,871
Then we will have identified an and we can add it back on to to some practice so sorry we could

998
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:36,223
Subtract it back off the receiver actor and did you steal again

999
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:40,063
That's how we actually would recover the transmission

1000
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:43,135
Any more questions

1001
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:47,743
Thank you for being here

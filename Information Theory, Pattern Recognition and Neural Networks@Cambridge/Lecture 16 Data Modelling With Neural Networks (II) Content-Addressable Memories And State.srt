00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:10,496
Welcome to lecture 16 this is the final

2
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:13,312
Lecture of this course

3
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:18,176
Today organic around talkin about neural networks and we're going to discuss

4
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:22,016
The content addressable memory challenge that I set

5
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,296
In the last lecture

6
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:26,880
And a little bit all right we'll have a little chat

7
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:28,416
About how that

8
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:32,512
Idea of how we solved the challenge

9
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:34,048
How that relates

10
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:37,376
Two state-of-the-art error-correcting codes that were

11
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:41,728
I discovered in the late 90s

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,824
Total Comfort full cycle back to the topic of the original

13
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,616
First lecture when we talked about

14
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:50,176
Are cracking codes for noisy channels

15
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:54,272
So I've highlighted in red are the two things weigh

16
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,296
Doing today

17
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:57,856
And

18
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:04,000
I'd like to just remind you what the content addressable memory challenges this is going to be the main thing will

19
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,024
Look at today

20
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:12,448
The challenge is to understand how do contacts restful memory how do we

21
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:18,848
Fill in the gaps how do we recognize Things based on that content even when some of the cues on noisy

22
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:20,896
And a precise wave

23
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,432
Same as challenges

24
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:26,784
Try and make a model of it make a dynamical system

25
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:29,856
That can do, is restful memory

26
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:36,000
I'll show you today a solution to this problem the task is

27
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:39,584
Botanical system with 25 variables each memory is

28
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,120
I-25 bit

29
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:45,472
State the dynamical systems 25 variables that change

30
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:50,592
In such a way that you got fixed points of the Dynamics at these

31
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,896
Say three desired memories

32
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:57,760
Whatever memories you you're given you should be able to make fix points on those memories

33
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:01,600
I'm the dynamical system should have

34
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:08,000
Promises that determine the Dynamics and is by adjusting those se300 promise

35
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:12,096
That you should be able to make the six points at the right places

36
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:20,288
And those six months should be attracting fixed point so if you're near to one of the divided Memories the dynamic should take you

37
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,568
To that memory

38
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,432
I'm so if you've added some noise to memory the noise gets cleaned up

39
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:31,296
That in itself would already be an exciting thing to solve

40
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:37,696
And it would look like this if you flip say free bits of Addie then you'd like the Dynamics of the dynamical systems

41
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:39,232
You back to a clean-up day

42
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:42,560
I know you see shouldn't be sending receipt on this thing

43
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:46,912
Is lucky day and it should be times that that's the goal

44
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,704
Have this problem

45
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,496
And

46
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:53,312
That sounds already hard enough

47
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:57,152
Additional constraint is when your brain encounters a new memory

48
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:02,016
You don't go out and buy some extra neurons from Dixons

49
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:09,696
You just carry on using the same brain and make some minor changes to it we don't know how

50
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:16,096
Buy those instantaneous changes that can be made very rapidly possibly with a little bit of sleep

51
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,728
You got your new memories added to the existing Hardware

52
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,312
And in addition

53
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:29,408
To be able to add extra memories incrementally with small changes

54
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:35,808
We would like to have the property that you'll dynamical system can go out for a drink and suffer brain damage and still

55
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,344
Working pretty well

56
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,112
So

57
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:40,160
We'd like a dynamical system web

58
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:45,280
A nasty person can come along and randomly delete half of the parameters that you

59
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,048
Lent

60
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:52,448
And the dynamic should still actually work it should still have attracting fix points that should still be rough

61
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,984
Play out the original memories

62
00:03:54,752 --> 00:04:00,896
Okay so that's what we're going to do and I just want to emphasize how different different this is from

63
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,944
DeSoto standard solution

64
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:10,368
Is there a standard solution to come addressable memory let's just invent unorthodox approach

65
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,136
Emphasize

66
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:17,536
How different a solution is going to be so what would an orthodox approach be well you can

67
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,815
Have a piece of

68
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,607
Memory

69
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,655
That contains

70
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,471
The different memories

71
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:32,383
So have a little label saying his memory number one number two

72
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,919
Number three

73
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:39,039
And then your dynamical system could take a state

74
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,831
Escalade

75
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:41,855
X

76
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:47,487
And we could create little comparatives

77
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,535
Which

78
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,887
Measure how far

79
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:58,495
X what state is from memory 1

80
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,055
So you have a soda

81
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:05,151
Subtraction operation that

82
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:09,247
Compares those bets or distance operation

83
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:13,087
I only have another piece of Hardware that doesn't distance operation

84
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,367
Comparing

85
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,463
The second memory to Acts

86
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:22,559
And you have another piece of how do I

87
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,607
That can pass

88
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,959
The FED memory 2X

89
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,799
And

90
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:36,127
Then you can have a piece of Hardware that measures

91
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:40,223
How big those differences are

92
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:50,975
And we're interested in which one of these is the closest

93
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,279
I'm sorry

94
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:57,375
Computer all of these differences these distances sorry

95
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:02,495
And then we

96
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,311
Compare

97
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:10,175
Find the minimum

98
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:13,759
Aziz

99
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,063
So we need some sort of

100
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,391
Argmin machine

101
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:24,767
Whose output is not identification of which of those three

102
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,303
Is the winner

103
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,935
And let's say that X is actually closest to the J in this case

104
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,215
Then it could

105
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,495
You can imagine a little

106
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,287
Lights coming on here that says

107
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,823
This one's the closest

108
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:43,199
And then finally we need a piece of Hardware that response to that light and says okay let's over right

109
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,991
Facts

110
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,783
Bye

111
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:50,111
Copying in the contents of

112
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:51,903
Jay

113
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,767
+ 2

114
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,559
Oops

115
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:04,959
If I'm the winner and the similar lines from this guy saying if I'm the winner

116
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,519
I got to overwrite X

117
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:16,479
Are you with me this little logic of what you could do you could write a computer program and it could take

118
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:20,575
Memory number runs from Walnut and the number of memories

119
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:25,695
Do a comparison keep a list of how far away we are then going

120
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,463
Ha

121
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,511
Figure out which was the closest one

122
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:34,911
Then go back look up memory on Degrassi

123
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:38,495
A memory area

124
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,287
You have a

125
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,335
Distance

126
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,127
Vector

127
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,663
Or difference

128
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,479
A different Vector computation area

129
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:51,039
These will be your distance is

130
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:53,855
And

131
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:54,879
Sofa

132
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,159
Okay

133
00:07:56,415 --> 00:08:02,559
Does that have any of the attributes we just wanted well if you want to add an extra memory you have to get some more

134
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,327
Hardware

135
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:07,167
And you have to add more comparison

136
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,959
Hard rabbit

137
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:15,359
Measures how far away things are outside that you have to upgrade you log me into that takes full

138
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,127
Things

139
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:18,431
To see which is the the smallest

140
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:24,831
I'm so you have to do a whole load of rewiring to Old Memphis and adding another memory

141
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,135
And if someone comes along and says

142
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:31,999
Here are some of your adjustable promises I'm going to accidentally

143
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,791
Splat a few of these

144
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,351
Then this whole dynamical system

145
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,655
Is going to compute

146
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,935
How far

147
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:46,847
Exes from messed up sea and it messed up to you the winter then you'll end up recording messed up Cesar

148
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:50,175
Has the property that if you mess any of this these parameters up

149
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,455
You would have messed up

150
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:57,855
The Regal so it doesn't have robustness to the slightest bit of damage and if you come

151
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:02,207
Tinker with the subtraction operation Hardware assembly

152
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,487
You will be in trouble

153
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:07,327
So this would be an orthodox way of saying

154
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:11,423
Which is the closest memory okay and mallets

155
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,471
Write that woman 2X

156
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,519
And it's

157
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,823
It is a Content addressable memory

158
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:22,431
But it doesn't have any of the robustness we won't know the extensibility

159
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:29,087
I described it as a one step

160
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:35,487
Orthodox solution then go away another way of making YouTube

161
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:38,559
Get most of the Dynamics in gradual would be to say

162
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:44,191
If you are the winner then you get to tug x a little bit towards you

163
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:46,495
Insert good X good

164
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:52,895
Elizabeth in the directions of wedding event as this thing it's all rights and settles it would end up

165
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:57,759
Being talked continuously towards whichever one it was supposed to in the first place

166
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:01,343
So you can make it a little bit more

167
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,671
Naturalistic but still

168
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:07,999
Useless pop-up says it doesn't have any of the properties roster

169
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:16,447
Something I'd like you to notice about this Orthodox approach to content addressable Rico is

170
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:22,847
What I just drawn on the bullet-head is exactly the same as a perfect brute-force Dakota for an error correcting

171
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:26,687
Recode decode with the list of words

172
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,455
In hair

173
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:33,855
Assuming that this distance measurement that you end up with hair is the correct distance measurement for the load likelihood

174
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,159
Viggo timer model

175
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:42,047
This is measuring how many bits are flipped between the annex

176
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:46,399
Then this would be the correct dakotah assuming were dating with a binary symmetric Channel

177
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:53,311
So there's a connection Brewing head of this this may remind you of it I'll decode

178
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,359
Recruiting codes

179
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,919
Decoding error correcting code is indeed

180
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:01,247
So they'll fine example of content addressable memory

181
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,015
Although

182
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:07,391
Why we made our accounting codes we didn't think of the code was as being memories that we wanted to recall

183
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:15,583
Okay so that's how you would do it Orthodox Lee and I gave you a whole bunch challenge to come up with a solution

184
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:20,703
And I will now show you a solution that was invented

185
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,519
I by John Heartfield to this problem

186
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,287
So

187
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,103
Hopefully shinichi using neural network

188
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:31,199
Which is a feedback Network that means is build out of neurons

189
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,527
Just like neurons we had before

190
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,319
Neurons that

191
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:39,135
Adult weighted inputs and send that

192
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,159
Outfits

193
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,951
But the wiring of

194
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,535
The hopfield network

195
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,559
Will have

196
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,839
Connections

197
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:50,143
Both ways

198
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,447
Between

199
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,495
All passing yards

200
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,287
So

201
00:11:56,543 --> 00:12:00,383
Every neurons output gets broadcast to every other

202
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:06,015
You're on another way of growing this would be to say his only outputs

203
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,807
Of all the neurons

204
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:13,439
They all come around a little race track like this

205
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:24,191
And then this is where they got of that inputs Wong

206
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,471
2

207
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,751
3

208
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,895
Free Fall answer for

209
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:43,391
And these places had one-two-three-four these 16 places here where the

210
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,183
Weights exist

211
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,095
But you could think of if I go in your wrongs

212
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,935
Send as an i x i

213
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,983
Weight Matrix connecting them

214
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:08,223
So let's go through how helpful that what works in fact told you everything you need to know it's made of neurons

215
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,527
And

216
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,855
So here are the relevant equations

217
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:18,463
The architecture of a network is is a feedback Network

218
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:24,351
A rule for the standard hopfield network is the weights are actually symmetric so the weight

219
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,887
Between

220
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,167
You're on wall

221
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:30,495
And you're on 3 is that equal to the weight

222
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,799
Going from your untreated are on what

223
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,919
Reactivity rule is each of the neurons

224
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:44,319
Compute this activation AI is somebody wjxt + Peter I do every neuron can

225
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:48,159
Can have a little biased dangling off as well go feed her

226
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:50,463
I have a tattoo

227
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,743
Is 3

228
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,279
I'm paid for

229
00:13:55,327 --> 00:14:00,447
And then having computer that activation you've got a choice of two ways of doing it one is

230
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,215
That

231
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,519
X-eye the output

232
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:08,383
X1 X2 X3 X4

233
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:12,223
XII is the hello tangent of

234
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,759
Your activation

235
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:20,927
Or another option is the extreme if you like low temperature limit

236
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,719
Of the hyperbolic tangent function

237
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,999
We just had to step

238
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:28,863
And that's what the binary hopfield Network

239
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,167
Rhode Island ending with it whether it's

240
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:33,727
Local field activation

241
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,519
His positive or negative

242
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:38,079
Okay and his jump field

243
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:42,431
He now works at Princeton and his retirement

244
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,735
Okay

245
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:51,647
That's the hospital Network I have nothing told you how to do content addressable memory to do confident content addressable memory

246
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:54,719
We need a rule for setting all of these wipes

247
00:14:54,975 --> 00:15:00,351
So in the example problem with 25 dimensional

248
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:04,191
Finally passing stool in the number of neurons will have it 25

249
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,799
The number of weight is 25

250
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:13,151
X 24 does no self Connections in this network

251
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:16,735
Find the symmetric 65 * 24 / 2

252
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:20,063
Is the number promises

253
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,671
Piranha

254
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:27,743
And what we need is a rule for setting them

255
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:34,911
And the extremely Simple Rules there are other ways of doing this but the simplest want to go with in order to solve

256
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:41,311
Discount addressable memory challenge is to say let's set the weights which are roughly 300 number

257
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,383
In this way using a head rule

258
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,431
Federal says

259
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:54,111
Set the connection between inj by seeing how correlated and XJR with each

260
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,647
Stella in all of the

261
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,439
Passions that you want

262
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:03,071
Alliance a n is the number of patents

263
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,119
Salon

264
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:09,727
Which in my djeasy example could be three

265
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:13,055
Once you add an n

266
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,383
Ben 10 will it become full

267
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:24,575
Physical behavioral because it's a very simple idea from biology named after

268
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,367
Ochako Donald Hebb

269
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,671
The idea is if you've got a pair of no wrongs

270
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:31,999
And I'm responding to something and if there's a connection between them

271
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:33,535
Then

272
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:40,191
Maybe that connection strengthens in proportion to correlate to the activities of the neurons are

273
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:43,007
You're on the tennis to respond to

274
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:49,407
Yellow colored things being in the Steam and if this is a neuron that responds to

275
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,175
2

276
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,967
The smell of banana

277
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:55,039
And it says two things

278
00:16:55,807 --> 00:17:00,159
Happen in a correlated way in the world to these neurons fire in a Carlito's Way

279
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:02,719
Then the synapse between them will get

280
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,743
Strengthen

281
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,791
Which then means that

282
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:10,143
If in the world are yellow thing comes along you may actually stop

283
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:13,471
Smelling the smell of banana even though the reasons I've been on

284
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,031
That's why there had been loading

285
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:23,967
And just one precise those associations that's the sort of thing that interests will memories all about

286
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,759
And her many

287
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:32,159
Other examples of strong associative mechanisms in our brains and in the brains of animals

288
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:38,559
I'd like to just mention as an aside is the amazing mcgurk effect which is an illusion

289
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:41,119
Where you see a video

290
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,679
Of someone speaking

291
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:47,519
Sardines like Bob

292
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:48,799
And

293
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,079
The OJ track

294
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,383
Has a voice saying so funny

295
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:55,711
But actually sneakily they switched up

296
00:17:56,223 --> 00:18:02,367
What the videos doing the soundtrack is doing and if you ignore the video you have the funding specially clearly but when you

297
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:08,767
See the visual image of them saying different phonemes you got to complete over I do you don't hear the correct phone in

298
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,535
Anymore

299
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,351
Because of the strong Association of the visual

300
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:15,167
Image of them saying Powerball

301
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:21,567
When you see that image is it can actually override what your ears are telling your brain is amazing

302
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:28,735
Okay so we have good I sell the lending rule it's cool to have Rule and we're not ready to go ahead

303
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,527
And demonstrate

304
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:31,807
The

305
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,111
Hopfield Network

306
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,391
So

307
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,183
What I'm going to do

308
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,463
Is

309
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:43,583
Train about field network with its 25 * 24/2 weights

310
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:46,143
Using these three patterns djc

311
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:51,519
And here are the weights that you got when you run the head rule let's just

312
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,799
Outback

313
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:53,823
And

314
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,383
Explain where these weights came from

315
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:59,199
So I'll use the mass killing

316
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:05,599
His the first weight is the weight between neurons warm and two and it's equals one what why is that

317
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,135
His near on wall

318
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,415
Is Neuron to

319
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,719
Or In this passage 1 and 2

320
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,487
Or this one

321
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,767
1 + 2

322
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:19,423
I take your head roll it says what's the correlation with holding each of these passengers plus or minus one depending weather for adults

323
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:24,799
Do Sports give you a plus one and two dogs gets you a plus one when you run your head rule

324
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:28,639
An Explorer Panda adult give you a -1

325
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:32,735
So we got plus warm when we look at x 1 x X-2 in this case.

326
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,759
So I have rules

327
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:36,063
First looks about pageants and get a plus one

328
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,087
So that way

329
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:43,743
Then you look at this pattern and you got another plus one so the way it goes up to 2 and then you look at the third person and you got

330
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:44,511
-1

331
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:48,607
Cuz that related to goes back down to one that's why this way just one

332
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:56,031
Now let's look at the wait between neurons two and three they are in the same state as what's Bluff

333
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,567
Slav squat

334
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:02,175
Okay and all of a sudden his row to column 3 or

335
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,711
Rio sweet home too if you like

336
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:08,319
S37 every time he's got a plus one because they're in the same state of each other

337
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,367
Neuron 3 and 4

338
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:14,975
That's Victory here again they're all the same and

339
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:20,863
So logically neurons two and four have to be the same in all states is Riley because another + 3

340
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,631
Okay

341
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:28,287
So I made all right just by running through all the passengers looking at every pair of neurons and adding

342
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:34,687
What's the tracking you on as you look at the pattern noticed this rule is incremental you can learn the first two passions if you want

343
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,711
And then

344
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:42,111
Having lunch then you can go through at the third person that will just involve taking all the weights and shoving someone

345
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,183
All right

346
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:52,095
No we're going to run the Dynamics and I'm just going to run the binary hopfield Network that

347
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,399
At what each neuron is either up or down

348
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,423
And

349
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,959
Owner off

350
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,263
And

351
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:05,663
I'll run through the neurons in sequence of the Dynamics I told you on the the earliest slide when we said what

352
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,735
I said

353
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:13,599
The activity rule is you computer activation then you sent X I using a step function

354
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:20,000
I didn't tell him how you do that precisely I'm actually going to run through them one at a time and sequence

355
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,280
Updating them

356
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:24,096
And I'll go back to the top and I'll run through a second time

357
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:26,656
1% time until I get bored

358
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:27,936
All right

359
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:34,592
So that's the particular way of implementing the Dynamics you could imagine also synchronously updating old

360
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:38,176
I'm not doing that it wouldn't make much difference in fact

361
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:41,248
Okay so let's stop by Ashley

362
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,856
Initiating the dynamical system at one of the desired

363
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:48,160
Memories

364
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:51,488
Silly old Orthodox way of doing things

365
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:56,352
Make us a little

366
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,400
Diagram keep track

367
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,192
Of what happens

368
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:10,176
She wants a blunt the memories we completely throw away DJ and see if there's no such thing in that we've just got the waitzkin

369
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:12,224
In your own sweet chili

370
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,040
What I'm going to do is make a little diagram

371
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:18,368
Where we see if we set off

372
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,440
But at what

373
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,000
In the state

374
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,304
DJ NC

375
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,608
Do we have to have a 6.2 tool

376
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:32,960
So you can think of the state space office dynamical systems

377
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:35,776
Having a d location in it

378
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:38,080
Add a location on sea location

379
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:44,480
And what we're going to do is test Deca if I set off this system where does it go

380
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,528
If you could easily imagine the Dynamics

381
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,832
Take it somewhere else with my so don't wander off

382
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,112
Guy who knows why

383
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,648
We're going to find out what happens

384
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,672
What happened

385
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:58,048
After 1 ish duration which means every neuron got the chance to update itself in accordance with rules

386
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,328
Nothing happened

387
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:03,680
So it is a stable point

388
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:04,704
Effects

389
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,472
So

390
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,848
First Column headers going to say no noise

391
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:16,736
I'm going to take the day that's pretty cool

392
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:19,808
Next we set up in the J

393
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,112
Suffix might as well

394
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,184
Then again for the Sea and the sea is also

395
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,488
Fix my dick

396
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,048
This is no nice

397
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:37,472
Now the content addressable memory challenge says we wanted to be an attractive six-point if we flip a few bits we want Medina

398
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:42,080
Amex to take us back to those fixed point so let's stop doing that we're not going to

399
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:44,128
Split a single bit of the day

400
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,968
And then we run the Dynamics and get a chance to change themselves

401
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,272
And what you find is the one that would fit

402
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,808
Implicit self

403
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,112
I will get back to the stable

404
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,392
Okay

405
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:57,440
So this is

406
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,000
Approximately 4%

407
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:02,816
Noise cuz we're flipping warm

408
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,096
How tall

409
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,144
25

410
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,704
So the folks at noise level the D

411
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,984
Came to a k

412
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,008
Jay

413
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,800
See

414
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:16,128
Right so single flips have oil Bean

415
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,200
Discovered corrected and we have a working

416
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,736
Comfortable memory

417
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:21,504
Seems

418
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:25,856
On the basis of its time at residence I'm exhausted looking for single flips

419
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:28,416
But it has corrected all those single flips

420
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,440
Next

421
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:33,024
Let slip some more single bits

422
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,304
Jay

423
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:39,168
See all those got corrected and that third one with two flips

424
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:42,752
Both neurons 1 and 2 flipped

425
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:47,360
And then the Dynamics of cleanup so I can correct to Flip's as well so we're up to

426
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,920
10%

427
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,016
Allen still working

428
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,112
That's a j

429
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,648
With three flips

430
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:01,184
Thanks or up to 15%

431
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:03,744
IND

432
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:06,048
Things are still working

433
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,888
There's a sea with three flips

434
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,424
And I got cleaned up

435
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,472
Seguin

436
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,288
Okay

437
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:22,944
So the way my software works is it always rotates through the DJ CDJ CDJ can test

438
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,504
So when it says setting up three

439
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,880
With their phone for picking memory number three and it makes three flips in so you can check

440
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,672
It was actually freeflix away

441
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,696
No

442
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:37,536
Is your question is right cuz I'm just going to keep the noise level

443
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:43,936
Until it stops working and you would very much expected not to work if we're flipping say 50% of the Bay

444
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:46,752
Cuz if you take any pattern and slipped 50% of it

445
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,544
It just feel random noise

446
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,128
At this point we definitely expect

447
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:58,272
Djz or not because it would be completely bizarre if it works

448
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:01,600
I'm just going to rotate through them adding more and more noise

449
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:06,464
So maybe it

450
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,072
Looks a little bit difficult to think about it

451
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,656
Has an IUD with three flips corrected

452
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:15,680
AJ

453
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:16,704
Hennessy

454
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,520
Now it's looking for some up to 18%

455
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,896
We're still getting ticks what was that one

456
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,944
How is a c corrected

457
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,224
Adi

458
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,504
With both lips

459
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,784
AJ

460
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,576
Odyssey

461
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:34,368
Nike XO

462
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:38,720
Full Hazmat and the noise level is up to 22%

463
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,792
Flipping five

464
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,096
D

465
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:48,704
Jay is taking more restoration some time to do the cleanup

466
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:51,520
So that's apparently annoy CJ

467
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,568
That's quite hard for us to tell now

468
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:57,664
06 Mitsubishi Eclipse up to 24%

469
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,736
And

470
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:02,016
Tatsunoya CJ

471
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,040
Got cleaned up

472
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,088
That's a noisy C

473
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:08,160
But you might struggle to recognize it but

474
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:13,280
It's okay so

475
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:17,120
What's next to D6 splits

476
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,912
Smoj

477
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,448
As soon as you see

478
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:27,360
I think you might struggle to look at that and say it annoys you see but it's still looking so that the 29% noise

479
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:32,224
And that was a seat

480
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,272
Still working

481
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:37,088
Nicd with 7 clips

482
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,368
Noisy Jay

483
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:42,208
And there was a noisy C

484
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,256
And what happened

485
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:45,792
AJ

486
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:49,120
All right and that was it 33% noise

487
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:55,520
So that was our first failure in this little sequence of experiments check

488
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:58,336
Like I said something bad has started happening

489
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:02,944
But we couldn't just double-check I've ever made that noise EC

490
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:06,784
We had a load of noise

491
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:11,392
The number flips wild eight flips

492
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:17,280
We can just do a computation now how far away was that initial state

493
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:19,072
We got hostiles to here

494
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,376
From

495
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:27,776
Vijai because it's hanging factors equally close to the Jay that we shouldn't really complain about this

496
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:31,872
Stop giving a subject let's just check

497
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:34,688
I'll count across

498
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:40,320
So we're looking at comparing these two with each other so Wong flip to flip 3

499
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:41,856
4

500
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,392
5

501
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,440
6

502
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:47,232
7

503
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,048
8

504
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,096
9

505
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:54,144
9 flips away

506
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,264
From the J

507
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,312
And I looked away from the sea

508
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,848
So you could complain

509
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:05,664
But Haven differences between

510
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:12,064
How far to walk from the J I'm from the city so it's almost reasonable

511
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:17,440
Attraction around to go to Basin of Attraction around here

512
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,488
You can hardly complain

513
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:27,168
Okay let's kick I eventually because it was loads of noise what will doing

514
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:27,936
Is not

515
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:34,592
How to get rid of noise and see if we get home we're just picking completely random starting point the same what happens now

516
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:39,712
Medical system and has quite a lot of behaviors that we haven't yet seen so let's keep going

517
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,992
This is an OG

518
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,272
I need to see

519
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:44,576
All right so that's another failure

520
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,672
But again it's probably justifiable

521
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:51,488
This is a noisy Jay and it gives us a j

522
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:52,512
Okay

523
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,816
Sarah still getting some successes

524
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,448
His and all you see okay so

525
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,496
Bill from successes

526
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:03,776
Nicd

527
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,080
Success

528
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:09,664
Noisy Jay

529
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:12,992
What's happened there

530
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,272
What's that

531
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:20,160
The Dynamics of going somewhere every other time Arc

532
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:24,256
And now we run the Dynamics when we go into Mojo Nicole at

533
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,352
Cute all right so it's discover the letter q

534
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:34,752
So we added some noise to a J Styles to a place where everything went downhill

535
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:39,872
I say downhill has any Hill that's all we've gone into a

536
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:45,248
So we've ended up in the stable site which has been named Q by the audience

537
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:51,648
All right and we can just some make a note of what a cute name instead of this

538
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:58,048
Would like that and Jazz at the same time

539
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:03,424
That is not actually a d is left I'm sorry it isn't the way these look

540
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,192
So

541
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:07,008
I think he was a good name

542
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,336
Right so that that was a new exciting things

543
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:16,992
Did the dynamical system we made has got fixed point that are attracting fix D&J NC

544
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,272
But it's not the mother fix

545
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,296
Points as well

546
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:23,136
Which showed us who knows why that but

547
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,672
His a noisy

548
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,696
Safe

549
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:27,744
What's happened

550
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,840
The flip 10 bits of a c

551
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:35,168
Let me run the Dynamics and what state are we in now

552
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,944
Somewhere between a Dana serum embodies look like

553
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:52,320
These look like that so

554
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:55,392
How is this thing related to Addy

555
00:31:55,904 --> 00:32:02,048
It's Angie d i k over here in state space is an GD everything is

556
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,072
Eclipse

557
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:05,888
And it is on TJ and his aunty c

558
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:10,240
States exist cool DanTDM

559
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:16,640
And it looks like I'm DD is a stable attracting fixed point that we've somehow got into by flipping

560
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:22,016
I say so are you dissing flips I'm going to run downhill or sorry we run the Dynamics

561
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,808
Who invented up in an TV

562
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:30,464
And again we could chat and it was looking 10 bit and I which is almost 50% so

563
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,304
Random starting point now it's completely irrelevant

564
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,400
We're just saying what are the fixed points does this system have

565
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,168
Does it

566
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:45,568
Only end up in 6.0 could it do chaotic things

567
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,360
And

568
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:50,432
When you reflect on it it's quite obvious that

569
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,736
The learning will it be hot

570
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,296
Is completely insensitive

571
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,064
2

572
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,136
Flipping elements of x

573
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,416
So if you

574
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:05,280
Total annual please learn ngd J&C instead

575
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:10,144
It wasn't exactly the same weights cuz you just -1 x -1

576
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,168
All right

577
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:13,216
Save the living room

578
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:19,872
Is completely agnostic and the dynamic changes

579
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,152
A single person

580
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:25,760
And that means if there is a fixed Point. D there must be a 6.2 DanTDM as well

581
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:32,416
Text Ashley Nelson surprise in retrospect there is this fixed Illinois

582
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,440
What's that

583
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:36,000
Antici all right

584
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:39,072
Let's add some noise to J

585
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:43,936
Who got Jay okay

586
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,728
Best bet

587
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:50,080
We're just exploring random condition

588
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,872
Initial condition

589
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:54,432
11 flips over sea and it gives us

590
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:55,456
What's that

591
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,320
Say

592
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:08,256
It's possible Jay but it's nothing today so it's strange J with is missing

593
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:12,352
Wake me up right we need a name for that

594
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:14,400
Tell me another

595
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:16,192
White

596
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,728
Aurora

597
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,896
So there's a thing that looks like that and that's a 6.2

598
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:30,016
Dota 2 which was an unintended fixed point

599
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:34,624
The tracks and we haven't attracting fixed point at the salafi thing

600
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,696
I got in there it is again I can't

601
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:39,744
Ledisi

602
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:46,912
AJ Styles AJ seems very good at attracting the Dynamics the J house

603
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:50,752
The song by DJ

604
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:57,152
Equally as big a basin of Attraction as Jay has gone both. Huge base

605
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:00,480
That looks off

606
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:02,784
Random initial conditions suck me into them

607
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,576
Okay

608
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:06,368
So what are we learned

609
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:13,536
It was just a memory by places we didn't intend but that doesn't really

610
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,632
What I'm going to do is

611
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:24,032
Part 2 of The Challenge was will this thing still work when you take it for a drink

612
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,080
And damaged neurons

613
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,128
Okay so you have a drink

614
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,152
Yes question

615
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:42,208
Okay so the question was how do you read things out is generating. Memories

616
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:48,608
Well it's only generating what do you mean by generating false memory if you mean you might accidentally

617
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:52,192
Some things Romeo driving dynamics that don't exist

618
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,984
Then

619
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:56,032
Second

620
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:00,640
I never showed you the cute but it has a fixed Point IQ

621
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:07,040
But was not in the rules of how a Content addressable memory should work the definition of a Content addressable memory is

622
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:10,368
If you show it a noisy bunch of a memory it should restore

623
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:11,648
To the original memory

624
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,928
And this doesn't

625
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,744
There wasn't a rule that said

626
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:19,072
If I give you a completely random inputs

627
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:21,376
You should only have a produce

628
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:23,424
Correct memory

629
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,984
That wasn't part of the job specification

630
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,008
All right

631
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:34,688
Nevertheless if you want to answer to the job certification we can do that and we can make neural-net learning algorithms

632
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:41,088
That will essentially fantasize come up with random ideas and check that fantasies still consistent with

633
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:45,184
Ramsey said that there is a normal strong interesting

634
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:51,584
I'm learning algorithms to know that your idea that you should make sure you don't have spirits

635
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,168
That's essentially what many of these algorithms about are about fake

636
00:36:55,424 --> 00:37:01,568
They both exposing the brain to reality and then having a dreaming face when that night you go and dream and then you make sure

637
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:05,920
The statistics of your dreams are consistent with the statistics of reality

638
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,200
That's one of the things

639
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:08,736
Okay

640
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:15,648
So much as you just expose it to the training cuz I'm slim that's my best friend

641
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,952
And then we have a dynamical system

642
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:21,280
So you can call these false memories if you want

643
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:27,680
Adjust Spirit sites of dynamical system is also

644
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:29,216
Fair enough name

645
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:34,080
What is corrupt the lights

646
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:40,992
So I got to take the weight Matrix that we learned with the head rule

647
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:46,368
But then I'm going to LEAP in and Destroy some of the weight so all of the weight for either

648
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,416
Plus one

649
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,440
+ 3

650
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:51,232
-100 - 3

651
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:52,512
But I'm just going to take

652
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:55,328
A fraction of those weights at random

653
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:57,120
N70

654
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:00,192
And then will rerun the Dynamics

655
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,216
Sucks

656
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:05,056
Handsome randomly corrupted weights the fraction corrupted

657
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:09,152
Is 79 out of

658
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:10,432
300

659
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:15,296
And now we're going to rerun the whole game that we just played really say

660
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:18,112
Is there a 6.5 velocity

661
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:19,392
So put in a day

662
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:21,952
I'm around the Dynamics we find

663
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:26,816
Yes Pacific Buddyfight what I've done is I Flip 3 bit so I'm taking

664
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:29,120
I'm going all the way to

665
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:31,168
Sarasota 15% dish

666
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,216
I'm saying

667
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:38,080
Is there an attracting fixed Point update

668
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:39,360
And

669
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:44,480
They say the D is okay for this example of flipping 3 bits

670
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:47,296
Let's take a giant flip three bits

671
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:49,088
Honda Civic 2.0 J

672
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:55,744
Let's take a c-clip three bits and there is a fixed point at sea

673
00:38:57,024 --> 00:39:02,656
That is weak evidence that there's some ticks all over here as well but let's not waste time

674
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:09,056
And we could go to High noise levels and see how big these attracting fix points

675
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:13,408
Are we could explore and see is there still looks. Wanaque and want a lesson

676
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,688
Well that's one thing as well

677
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:18,016
But I'm not going to do that I'm just going to mow lights

678
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:22,112
So now we're going to destroy Mohlenhoff 258

679
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:24,672
Over 300 weight so not being set

680
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,696
2-0

681
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:28,256
Are we we're on the Dynamics we say

682
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:30,560
If I take Addy and I'd some noise

683
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:31,584
Where do I go

684
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,376
An answer is

685
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,168
Traffic spot

686
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:41,568
But isn't quite exactly the day but it's only different by one bit which I think is a pretty good situation given that we've

687
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:42,848
Destroyed more than half

688
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:43,872
All the promises

689
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,152
And the network

690
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,176
Suck

691
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:47,968
Nah

692
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:55,392
Almost right so I'll give it a tick with a Twitter that just says one bit is off in this next month

693
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:56,928
Noisy Jay

694
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:58,720
That's clean up iMessage a

695
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:01,024
So that's a success

696
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,816
Noisy sea

697
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:04,096
Gets turned into

698
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,120
IC

699
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:10,752
So we've destroyed more than half the weights and it still working

700
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:15,616
And if we had time we could explore what's happened to this boundary hair

701
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:19,968
Where it stops working service somewhere hereabouts

702
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:26,880
Presumably the Sun by Andre maybe it comes through so their backs and eventually if I destroy enough weight

703
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:28,672
Presumably the whole thing is going to stop

704
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:30,464
Working down here

705
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:37,120
So there's something about Andre and we just thought it might look something like that green light

706
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:41,216
Destroyer movie Chester Tech 257

707
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:44,800
All the way

708
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,336
At random

709
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,872
The question is

710
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:51,200
What happens to the d2j

711
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:51,968
Mercy

712
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:54,784
Which side of the green line have we we go

713
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,832
So we put in an ICD

714
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:57,856
Angry cat

715
00:40:58,112 --> 00:41:00,928
Something I did not do flips away from

716
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:01,696
Adi

717
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:03,744
Alright so

718
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,608
Okay it's not really that great

719
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,752
Put Illinois to Jay and we got mumbo-jumbo rubbish

720
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:20,128
That's not it still got a fixed point the dynamic have fixed point but

721
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:21,920
That's not what I wanted

722
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:25,248
You see which is one click away

723
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,576
Okay so given that

724
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:33,696
None of those are being correctly stored I think it's fair to say that the green line

725
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:36,256
Stop somewhere on that that side

726
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:39,072
Maybe something like that

727
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:45,216
Okay there's a huge but just want to have rules that looks if you want to and she know where that boundary goes and

728
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:46,752
Clever physicists have

729
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,360
Explicit closed form solutions for

730
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:53,663
For this diagram the weakest cast

731
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:57,759
Now what are we do

732
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:04,415
What was the other definition of a Content addressable memory you should be able to add some extra memories to it by a small change of income

733
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:07,999
And it should still have all the old memories on the new one

734
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:10,815
So what we not going to do is

735
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,607
Telegram

736
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,399
Where

737
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:22,079
We vary the noise level again

738
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:24,127
From zero

739
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:27,455
To say 15%

740
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:29,759
4 more

741
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:36,671
And we just found this DJ and see, and now we're going to say

742
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:39,743
One more memory is full

743
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,791
Or maybe even five

744
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:43,583
Oh maybe even 6

745
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:45,375
But at some point

746
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:47,167
Play imagine this thing light notebook

747
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:49,983
And what we've established

748
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,543
So far

749
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:55,359
Is that this worked out to some

750
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,407
29%

751
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:03,295
So this is all text

752
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,319
Up to here

753
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:10,719
Play maybe not sure we didn't actually look at every single noise

754
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:12,255
Vitanova

755
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:14,815
Mariscos m

756
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:16,863
So there is the end

757
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:20,447
And what does that mean we do with the weight well

758
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:23,775
Every way either goes up by 1 or down by one

759
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:30,175
Because he just look at the correlation within the empatan of the spins with each other server example this one was used to be

760
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,711
What was it plus one

761
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:33,503
What's the connection between these two

762
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:36,831
No in the end you can see there an opposite States

763
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,623
Just going back down to zero

764
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:42,207
So that's why that weight has become zero and it was plus one

765
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:44,511
All right and

766
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:46,047
This weight

767
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:49,119
Has gone up to full that's the way between 2 and 3

768
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:51,679
And they are both in the adult State hair

769
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:55,007
So that's why we got an extra plus woman that weight has been up before

770
00:43:55,775 --> 00:44:01,919
The old way to just mean tweet the time little bit the least significant bit of every weight

771
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:04,223
Peanuts a little bit up or down

772
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:07,551
And that tiny change we hope

773
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:13,951
Has created a completely new fixed point that didn't exist before you can take take it from me I can prove it

774
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:18,559
The previous dynamical system did not have a fixed point at em

775
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:20,607
Now we make this tiny change to it

776
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:27,263
And we put in a d and it still takes pine tree put in a j it's fixed Point could you just see if it can you put in an m

777
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:31,359
We have fixed points

778
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:35,967
All right writing fixed points lets out a little bit of noise and fine art

779
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:39,039
The one bit flips is correct its buddy

780
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:40,063
PJ

781
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:41,343
Sissy

782
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,159
And I am okay so that was all right

783
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:48,255
Oneflix corresponding to 5%

784
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:51,071
Nice

785
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:53,119
Right

786
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:56,959
Next let's try cooking a bit more is another one flip

787
00:44:57,215 --> 00:45:02,335
I'm getting a bit more slowly. I want to be honest with you about when this thing stopped working

788
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:04,383
But that's one flap corrected

789
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,919
Idonije

790
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:08,991
I know you see with one flip a not so fine tick

791
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:14,367
Is annoy the end and it was fine to attack so had to run through

792
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:17,183
All at 5%

793
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:18,463
Noise

794
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:19,743
One flip

795
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:22,303
I got his another on D

796
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,071
Jay

797
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:24,095
See

798
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:27,423
Am I got those Rolex

799
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:31,263
So it seems pretty good at cleaning up single bit flips

800
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:33,823
Nicd

801
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,103
Jay-Z

802
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:35,871
NM

803
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:38,687
Well like I said I had full run-throughs

804
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:40,479
Call with single flips

805
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,783
Right now it's looking to

806
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:45,343
The noise level up to 8%

807
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:47,903
And the D is I can

808
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:51,231
D j c

809
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:55,327
Night so that's correcting to flips

810
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:00,447
Noisy

811
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,727
Jay

812
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:03,007
See

813
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:08,639
Holiday formal text

814
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:11,967
Again those rules to bits being flipped

815
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:13,247
Nicd

816
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,015
Jay

817
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:15,295
See

818
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:19,391
Okay did anyone notice anything

819
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:24,511
That is antonym

820
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:25,279
Yeah

821
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:29,631
What is it it's two bits away from them

822
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:31,167
Yeah

823
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:32,959
Cast what does the name look like

824
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:35,519
Become say it anymore that is

825
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:40,895
2nd drive and 4th Road Blocks initiative.

826
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:42,687
Right so that's a failure

827
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:44,991
It's two bits away

828
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:54,463
So it's not working absolutely perfectly that it got another six point but we didn't ask for

829
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:55,487
And

830
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:59,327
Sometimes when we slept two bits it finds that fix bike

831
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:02,143
AJC

832
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:09,055
Okay so that was a success again this is still flipping two-bits long 2/3

833
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:12,895
So just have one failure out of 16 in the to flip

834
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:14,175
Territory

835
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:16,223
No sleep in 3 bits

836
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:16,991
D

837
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:17,759
Jay

838
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:20,831
Is it

839
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:27,743
What's wrong with that it differs by 2

840
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:31,583
3 bits from a j. Left

841
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:34,911
Does this one under his bottom left-hand corner

842
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:37,727
So those are

843
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:41,311
333 turtles next to that

844
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:46,175
So it looks a bit like a j but it isn't the J memory

845
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:47,967
Today

846
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:49,759
Now you see that's okay

847
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:51,295
That's okay

848
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:52,575
D

849
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:53,599
Jay

850
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:54,623
Say

851
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,927
D

852
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:58,207
Jay

853
00:47:58,719 --> 00:47:59,231
See

854
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:06,399
Noisy I'm okay so what happened 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 on the failure

855
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:08,959
There's still quite a d

856
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:11,007
The three Flats J

857
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:11,775
See

858
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:14,079
That was another full of success

859
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:20,479
I got says not working but it's only failing into out of 16 cases at this noise level

860
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:23,807
Noisy d j

861
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:24,831
See

862
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:27,903
I left something like this isn't it

863
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:31,231
And I'm alright so when were sleeping full bits

864
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:35,839
Which is hairish 17%

865
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:42,239
We're getting some failures show

866
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:43,519
This is for flips

867
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:45,567
I'm getting some ideas

868
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:49,919
All right so I've got weak evidence

869
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:52,479
That things are getting bad

870
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:56,063
Hereabouts so still looks for the basis of attraction

871
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,599
Quite so big

872
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:04,767
What are the next five memories okay so the memories are not Cody j c and x

873
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:06,047
Is a checkerboard pattern

874
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:07,071
That I

875
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:08,095
Picked

876
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:09,631
All right

877
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:16,031
So all the weights with - 4 - 2 0 2 or 4 on Arcane Spike

878
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,567
Odd numbers

879
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:18,591
Right

880
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:21,407
Do we have fixed points

881
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:23,967
Let's try the D yes is a fixed point

882
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:30,367
BJC and context

883
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:32,927
There is a fixed Point J at Sea

884
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:34,207
And an

885
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:36,767
IMAX I kept so we still have

886
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:39,071
Effects point

887
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:44,191
Is it an attracting fixed Point can we flip some bits

888
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:46,239
Pick up things

889
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:50,335
Short I'm going to go to 15% noise levels I'm going to flip 3 bits

890
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:52,127
And see what happens

891
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:53,663
Hereabouts

892
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:56,223
Announcer is noisy d

893
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:57,759
Just turned into

894
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,575
Auntie Em

895
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:05,439
Know your date is it today

896
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:07,231
OUC is ik

897
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:11,327
Noisy Adam is okay and noisy actually got turned into

898
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:17,727
I don't know what that is so that was sort of bad okay okay okay

899
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:21,567
I'm bad which isn't looking very good so I probably this green line

900
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:23,359
It's somewhere I like that

901
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:32,063
I got so it's not really working anymore we ended the fifth memory and is the basis of Attraction if better

902
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:35,135
If the reservation that's all that really quite small

903
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:41,279
Let's try again with the noisy d

904
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:42,559
Lazy J

905
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:43,839
Alluc

906
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:45,119
Noisy an

907
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:52,543
I know you ask a guy old love those actually work so we had five more successes

908
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:57,151
Write 6 memories

909
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:58,175
So

910
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:04,831
Will probably pushing a lot 9 DJ cmx Unlimited

911
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:06,111
And I look like this

912
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:13,023
So that's the six persons the weights now it'll be even numbers if you treat them all up or down by one

913
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:18,143
And we put in D to check it affects point

914
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:22,495
We got something it looks a bit like ass but it's off by one bit

915
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:27,871
Jay is a fixed Point C is not fixed point

916
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:30,431
That turned into

917
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:32,991
Something that looks like a stupid is off by one b****

918
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:39,391
And is not a big client is turned into an GS with one bit flipped that's not very good

919
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:41,951
X

920
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:43,743
Turns into

921
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:44,767
With one big lips

922
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:47,583
I-ness turned into Asheville

923
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:51,679
So that's bad on this is okay with a little twiddle

924
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:56,799
Right so it's really not working anymore so this Green Boundary

925
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:59,103
Comes in hereabouts at

926
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:02,175
6 memories and if we

927
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:05,503
Ask the question

928
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:11,903
Could you have made a hotel that what good did have fixed points at all of these if only you could use a different money out of

929
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:13,695
Instead of the head roll

930
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:15,487
Well how could we do that

931
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:19,583
One way to think about it is every one of these neurons

932
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:22,911
Is a single neuron

933
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:27,263
And we already have a learning algorithm for training single neurons

934
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,311
Remember when we were training pigeons

935
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:31,103
Sorry pigeon replacements

936
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:35,455
To distinguish raising from Pebbles so we could use the learning algorithm

937
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:38,015
For single neuron to neuron

938
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:39,807
To classify

939
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:46,975
The D passing as a + 100 - 1 depending whether that neurons should be in-state + 100 - 1

940
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:47,999
Minutes in a day

941
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:51,327
I'm trying this one simile

942
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:52,351
With

943
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:55,423
Every possible input DJ cm in soflo

944
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:56,191
With

945
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:58,495
The correct label being

946
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:04,895
Blue or yellow football of -1 depending on whether this one should be up or down

947
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:08,223
How's it going to look up table of what it should do in those those

948
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:10,015
Those dates and you can run

949
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:12,575
Individual learning algorithms but each of them

950
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:19,231
In fact a couple to each other cuz the whites have to be symmetric so you run out of hole

951
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:20,255
Subjective function

952
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:24,351
And it is actually possible to come up with a setting of weights

953
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:27,167
Which O'Hare

954
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:30,751
Here are a set of Weights that will found by

955
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,543
Training the algorithm

956
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:33,823
On those

957
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:38,687
6 examples of each neuron being told whether it should try to be up or down

958
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:43,551
I'm not when you run the Dynamics talking to a dude you got a d j u got today

959
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:46,111
Percy you got to see him cuz fam

960
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:49,439
X cos x sin x cos y so you can

961
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:55,839
Still tweet the way she just don't use the head rule anymore you do something bit smarter

962
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:58,399
How do you take the weights just a little bit

963
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:04,031
And we got six points in all the right places so it was possible to get the whole field Network to have fixed points

964
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:10,943
If we use the different letting I'll go anyway the main part of the show was the hebra which is so fantastic

965
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:17,343
Simple and clearly biologically plausible to some very easy algorithm to learn to do employment

966
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:23,487
All the neurons in a correlated State on alternate route to sign ups strength up or down

967
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:24,255
Accordingly

968
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:31,167
Does this thing have a tracking six-point well know if you are mad

969
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:33,215
Of noise 2D you got ass

970
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:34,495
J wax

971
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:36,287
See you guys to ask

972
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:37,823
I'm goes on TS

973
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:38,591
End

974
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,895
Text with flipzco SAS

975
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:44,735
And that's what some folks ghost is still not looking very well but at least

976
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:47,039
It did have some fixed points in the right place

977
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:49,087
And I think that might be

978
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:52,671
The end of that show

979
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:59,327
So there is a whole field Network and in my view it's a pretty exciting solution to the content addressable memory

980
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:00,095
Challenge

981
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:10,079
We've got a candidate solution to come and wrestle memories and the whole field network is itself an interesting thing

982
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:16,991
It is a dynamical system is it even got fixed why does it have stable States

983
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:23,647
How many memories can it learn what is its capacity I showed you a tiny example with just 306 memories

984
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:26,463
25 neurons and bigger

985
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:32,863
And if all the neurons are connected to each other how many bits can you still have any random patterns

986
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:36,191
Can you train this thing on using Navy Federal

987
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:41,567
This is an interesting system we've started to study what house

988
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:44,895
What can we do with it what ideas inspired by the film Network

989
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:46,175
I'm going to spend

990
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:48,223
The final 20 minutes or so

991
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:54,623
Answering a few these questions why does the network have some stable States well I wouldn't be

992
00:55:54,879 --> 00:56:00,511
Surprised if you recognize what we've just been doing have you seen these equations before

993
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:03,839
Activation is a linear sum of

994
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:05,887
Texas exes

995
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:08,191
Sayings by putting the

996
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:10,495
Hey use the activation function

997
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:12,031
Have you seen that before

998
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:18,431
Yes you see me before because two nights ago we discussed variational methods

999
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:20,991
Spin system with coupling School jmn

1000
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:28,159
Then you want to approximate the nasty complicated couple system by a variational approximation

1001
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:34,815
Out pops these equations which all exactly the same as knuckle W because that weights in a neural network

1002
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:41,471
And the H's which was applied Fields local fields and the physics problem

1003
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:44,543
Has the biases of neurons

1004
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:49,663
Thanks of equations are identical we seen this before time tables the page of text that we had

1005
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:50,687
In the textbook

1006
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:52,991
And an Alexa why we derived

1007
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:54,527
These equations

1008
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:57,087
As a variational approximation to something

1009
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:02,975
Spitz Auto Parts why did about the world since it's an approximation to something

1010
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:08,095
Maybe we interesting to actually implement the something instead of implementing approximation

1011
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:09,887
And that idea is called

1012
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:11,423
The boltzmann machine

1013
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:12,447
So

1014
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:15,263
A little spin out I'll just mention

1015
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:16,799
Is

1016
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:24,223
Hopfield network is a variational free energy

1017
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:27,551
Minimisation approximation

1018
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:30,367
2

1019
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:32,159
A probability distribution

1020
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:37,279
Of Acts which is the same old thing that we had for the spin system

1021
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:41,887
Need to be over in jxi

1022
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:45,983
W i j XJ something like that it will take

1023
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:47,519
A possible sign era

1024
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:54,687
Sensei an approximation that we could call Q

1025
00:57:55,967 --> 00:58:02,111
I'm not motivated to hey maybe we can make a neural network that Implement p and we could have a whole world

1026
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:03,647
Neural networks that

1027
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:09,535
Actually do pee so the boltzmann machine

1028
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:12,863
Is the neural net communities name full

1029
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:16,959
These the Catholic neural network but samples from this distribution

1030
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:21,055
And there's a whole bunch of games you can play with those you can

1031
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:26,175
Have learning algorithms where you say let's pray in the probability distribution of the bulk machine

1032
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:28,223
To have some properties we want like

1033
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:33,087
Assign high-probability just a memory that we want to learn or you can have other

1034
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,903
Things that you want to do other associative memory

1035
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:39,487
So does that literature on both machines

1036
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:44,095
And if you want them to do letting you need to have Lenny I'll go and spoil them

1037
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:45,375
And

1038
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:47,679
Just complete this aside

1039
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:52,799
If you write down what the learning algorithm is

1040
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:56,639
For the bolts machine

1041
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:59,199
If what you wanted to do

1042
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:02,015
Is assigned high probability to send a memories

1043
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:07,135
Then what you find is the very first step about learning algorithm is

1044
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:08,927
Behavioral

1045
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:10,207
Let me have

1046
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:15,583
And I'm the guy so if you wanted where do they have real come from all his one way of deriving it

1047
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:17,887
Write down the real probability distribution

1048
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:19,679
Write down the learning algorithm

1049
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:23,263
Make one step of stupidest Anthony find you got a head rule

1050
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:25,567
That's a little aside

1051
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:28,127
No

1052
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:35,295
The fact that the whole field network is associated with the variational free energy means that it's Dynamics

1053
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:40,159
Have I lie upon a function so that's why but I do have stable States

1054
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:41,439
The Dynamics

1055
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:44,255
Take you down hill on the variational free energy

1056
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:47,071
Find because that is a function

1057
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:47,839
That

1058
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:53,983
Is love a bounded by something obviously negative

1059
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:58,591
So by observing that we've already seen this thing and it came out of

1060
00:59:58,847 --> 00:59:59,871
An objective function

1061
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:05,759
We got a proof of the fact that Networks

1062
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:07,807
Dynamics

1063
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:12,927
Do minimize injective function and Bethel that exist

1064
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:14,719
6 points

1065
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:18,047
Dynamics

1066
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:21,631
Minimize vaginal fantasy vaffle

1067
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:25,983
There exists fixed points

1068
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:30,591
And the Dynamics

1069
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:34,431
Always go into one of these six points and stop

1070
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:42,623
It didn't have to be that way you can easily right then. I'm at the systems that don't have objective functions that decrease

1071
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:49,023
It's easy to make healthy systems but just go bubbly bubbly bubbly and randomly wander around and end up in limits like

1072
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:50,559
Wilson cycle

1073
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:52,095
No

1074
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:56,703
Another question almost in question was what is the capacity of hopfield network

1075
01:00:56,959 --> 01:01:01,823
And this is being studied by the physics community that goes Attract it into neural networks

1076
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:05,919
And they have established that if n is very large

1077
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:09,503
And if I is very long so I is the number of neurons

1078
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:15,903
And is the number of patents

1079
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:23,071
Instantly the number parameters

1080
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:24,095
Then

1081
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:26,399
And also Network

1082
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:27,935
Is roughly

1083
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:29,471
I spread over to

1084
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:36,639
If you make both I and enlarge then what you find is

1085
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:43,551
Set the hook on that works for an override less than a critical value and it doesn't work at all

1086
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:44,319
Andover eye

1087
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:47,391
Above that critical value so these two graphs are all showing you

1088
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:50,719
How good the overlap is between

1089
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:56,607
Design memory that you're trying to recall on the nearest stable State the nearest fix point

1090
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:00,703
And you can see if a Nova is less than 0.1 full Rosa

1091
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:07,103
Betty got very big of a lot which is wonderful but you go above .14 and you got this catastrophic failure

1092
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:10,943
That means that you can learn

1093
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:17,087
Ventolin perfectly instantly notice how the black line isn't quite equal to 1

1094
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:19,391
To any value of n over I

1095
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:23,743
So good there is a six-point but it's not quite in the right place

1096
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:25,791
Debra Loomis

1097
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:33,215
Does this critical value and crit is 138

1098
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:37,055
That means the number of random bits that are able to learn

1099
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:38,847
And sore Indies

1100
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:40,383
Promises

1101
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:44,223
The number bitchslut if your just below that critical point

1102
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:45,759
Is roughly

1103
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:52,159
And Chris X High because each of the entrance patents you learned has

1104
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:54,207
I randomly chosen bits in it

1105
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:57,023
So that's roughly I squared

1106
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:59,071
* 9.138

1107
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:02,911
If you take the ratio of this number Betsy blunt

1108
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:04,703
To this number promises

1109
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:08,543
The ratio is about 2.2. Weight

1110
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:11,871
So that's a nice for the rule of thumb again

1111
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:18,271
In the last lecture we talked about training a single neuron and we observe that a single neuron

1112
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:19,551
Conlon

1113
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:22,623
Random person random labels

1114
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:26,463
Opossum and it couldn't load up to 2 bits per byte

1115
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:30,559
Nothing that work with the head broken glenpointe to full bits

1116
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:33,375
Hawaii time then it stops working beyond that

1117
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:36,191
This is a result for random patterns onto the Hebrew

1118
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:43,103
My final question balls what else can we do with these hopfield Network IDs

1119
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:46,943
But when I did that John Heartfield himself had walls

1120
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:49,503
Since the Hot Wheel network does minimize things

1121
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:54,367
How about we go out into the community of people who try to minimize things because that's a job

1122
01:03:54,623 --> 01:04:00,767
I'm trying to solve a problem with

1123
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:02,559
I think it'll do a minimisation for you

1124
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:05,375
So let's give you an example

1125
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:15,871
Let's discuss the traveling salesman problem

1126
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:17,919
The traveling salesman problem

1127
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:22,271
Is the task of picking a tool that visits in cities

1128
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:26,111
How do you want to minimize the distance the length of the tour

1129
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:28,927
So

1130
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:35,583
Where should we go now

1131
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:39,167
And I'm going to show you

1132
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:42,495
First the traveling salesman problem with full

1133
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:43,519
Cities

1134
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:48,127
I'll describe how you can look

1135
01:04:57,087 --> 01:05:01,183
So you go to the back page of the road atlas

1136
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:04,511
And it often has a thing that looks like this yeah

1137
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:12,447
Which has a list of names of cities on Melrose and sisters on half and these are the distances between the 50s

1138
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:17,823
So you have the distance between cities iamb distance between

1139
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:21,663
Hey I'm see here distance between AMD

1140
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:24,479
Distance between BMC and surface

1141
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:28,319
And you looking at triangle of distances and then you'll told

1142
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:32,671
Here are all the cities you must visit a b

1143
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:33,695
See

1144
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:35,231
Andy

1145
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:41,375
You can look up and not trying don't want the distances and you have to pick a tour

1146
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:42,911
Which is

1147
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:43,679
A

1148
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:45,983
Sequence of

1149
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:50,335
Maybe a for us to be second

1150
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:56,991
C4 and then back to a so close tour

1151
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:59,039
And the task is to find a toy

1152
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:01,087
Which minimizes the total distance

1153
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:03,391
This task

1154
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:06,975
Is an NP complete problem that means it's hot

1155
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:14,143
I could give a more precise definition but

1156
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:18,239
Brabus is it just means it's an interesting thing if you can do

1157
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:25,407
Anything on the schedule and we don't expect have a perfect solution cuz it np-complete means

1158
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:26,943
You would

1159
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:30,271
Get an award if you could actually do it perfectly

1160
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:34,367
Okay so you got to pick a permutation

1161
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:37,439
And you want to minimize the total distance

1162
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:39,231
So the goal is

1163
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:42,815
Find a permutation

1164
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:46,911
All

1165
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:49,983
ABCD sucks at the tool

1166
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:54,079
Minimizes

1167
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:56,127
The total

1168
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:57,919
Distance

1169
01:06:59,199 --> 01:06:59,967
Okay

1170
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:01,759
You can think of this as

1171
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:08,159
Being a problem with two objectives the real objective is to minimize the total distance but there's no

1172
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:11,231
Objective Lucky in that which is redo one please

1173
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:12,511
A permutation

1174
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:18,143
John Hopkins approach to this problem what you did with David tank

1175
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:19,167
Waltz

1176
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:19,935
2

1177
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:21,983
Make a network witch

1178
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:24,287
Minimizes a single objective function

1179
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:30,687
That is a sum of you if you like of these two things the objective of minimizing Solutions Plus the objective of beer

1180
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:31,711
Implementation

1181
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:33,503
How do you do that

1182
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:34,783
Well

1183
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:36,319
You making that work

1184
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:38,111
Representation

1185
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:42,207
Oh

1186
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:51,167
A tour like objects that may or may not have to be at or across the top we have place

1187
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:55,519
Stint or does a city come first second third or fourth

1188
01:07:55,775 --> 01:08:00,895
And on the left hand side will have cities a b c d

1189
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:05,759
And if a comes first service the tour is say acdb

1190
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:07,807
Secom second

1191
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:10,623
Dcoms

1192
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:12,671
I'm becomes 4th

1193
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:18,559
Then you could imagine switching on these will neurons in switching the other 12

1194
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:19,327
Neurons

1195
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:25,471
And that would be a way with 16 neutrons of representing this particular permutation

1196
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:28,543
There's actually several ways of doing it cuz you can slide

1197
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:32,895
You can wrap around in this way unless four different ways of representing the same

1198
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:34,687
Auto store

1199
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:36,991
Okay

1200
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:40,831
So that's the network representation now we need to wire up

1201
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:46,975
The neurons to each other in a way that enforces these two objectives of please make a permutation

1202
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:54,143
Please have small title distance so we need things that enforced limitation

1203
01:08:57,471 --> 01:09:02,335
And we could explicitly have some Uber conversation that says

1204
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:04,639
Is this thing a permutation or not

1205
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:08,991
But that would not be local in it we don't be distributed and it wouldn't be

1206
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:15,135
The way to do it in a hotel Network away well if it's a limitation then there's only one won in a row

1207
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:19,231
And if it would to Wong's in in a row or column

1208
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:22,559
Oh that would be bad so something we can do is we can say

1209
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:25,119
Let's have negative weights

1210
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:28,959
From one neuron to everyone who is in

1211
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:30,239
ISRO

1212
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:32,287
Unless have negative weights

1213
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:37,919
Trevon Hughes in his column I'm sorry I said that back to front but it doesn't matter

1214
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:39,967
They have negative weight

1215
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:43,807
From you to everyone in Euro and everyone in your column

1216
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:48,159
And you repeat that for all your wrongs

1217
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:51,743
Then we need to have a way off

1218
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:56,351
How to make you think are about minimizing a distance as well as just

1219
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:58,143
Creating a presentation

1220
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:00,191
So how do we do that

1221
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:01,727
Wow

1222
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:03,519
If

1223
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:06,591
This neuron is on here

1224
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:08,895
And if this neuron is on

1225
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:10,687
But not means that

1226
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:12,223
Became second

1227
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:12,991
And

1228
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:15,807
Kang said

1229
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:22,975
Anar something in this network had better be aware of that and care about the distance between B&D because be house being put in

1230
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:23,999
2D

1231
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:25,791
So we're going to have a weight

1232
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:27,327
Color green

1233
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:29,375
For minimizing car listings

1234
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:31,935
Between nice

1235
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:35,007
It will be minus the distance between B and D

1236
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:38,079
Similarly

1237
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:41,663
Wi - DVD between those two

1238
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:44,223
A-minus DBC between those

1239
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:47,295
And mine is DBA between those

1240
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:50,879
Etc replicated across

1241
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:52,927
Alright so

1242
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:56,255
If you're in the same Rosie Charlie going to have a red wait connecting you

1243
01:10:56,511 --> 01:11:02,655
And that's in column likewise if you're in adjacent columns but different Rose you will have one of these

1244
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:03,935
Green lights connecting you

1245
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:08,799
And if you're not in adjacent columns then you won't have any weight

1246
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:15,199
If you're in different columns and rows the way will be zero so I'm going to have them done that here

1247
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:21,599
So here is the the network with some red squares to hear the neurons that 16 of them

1248
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:27,231
And if I put the mask on in your own you can see all the weights connected to that Neurontin some of them all

1249
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:28,511
Feasible -8

1250
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:33,631
Some of them - 7 sum of -5 -4 and 3/4

1251
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:40,031
Why well let's go look at some of these so why is this wait -7 it's because those

1252
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:42,591
Neurons are in the same rows each other the purple and green one

1253
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:46,687
Rights to all of these seven off of neurons that are in the same

1254
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:48,479
Bro as each other

1255
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:54,111
Thought I just picked seven to be a distinctive number that's the negative weight for being in the same Rohit Samos Evans

1256
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:59,743
On an hissimo 7 1/4

1257
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:01,279
Which is the same Rosita

1258
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:03,839
The sevens roll pin earrings

1259
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:05,119
Okay

1260
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:07,679
Now why is this a 5

1261
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:12,031
Well that's because those two are in the same column is each other and all the fives

1262
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:15,359
Off of neurons that are in each other

1263
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:16,895
All right

1264
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:18,175
Picnic picnic

1265
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:23,295
Why is this a woman relaxing warm because

1266
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:25,087
Not A and B

1267
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:30,207
Inerrant adjacent columns so we need to know about the distance between and I'll just put them on this warm

1268
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:33,535
All of those red weights are warm because

1269
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:35,071
Those are neurons that

1270
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:39,423
If both of them are on a comes next to be in the tour

1271
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:42,495
These ones are warm because

1272
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:45,823
The distance from B to C is 1 and if those

1273
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:48,895
Has neurons are on the NBA's coming to see

1274
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:50,687
Either one

1275
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:52,735
Because the distance

1276
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:55,551
Between C and D is warm

1277
01:12:56,063 --> 01:12:59,135
That's it for us oh my actual distance table says

1278
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:01,183
A2B Islam

1279
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:09,631
B2c it's 1

1280
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:19,103
And see today is a distance of 1

1281
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:26,271
Meanwhile a 2d is an explicitly is

1282
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:30,879
Nicoby far and can only get that on the road I think six

1283
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:37,279
Between a and C

1284
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:40,607
And between B and

1285
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:45,727
That's my assumed

1286
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:47,775
Links for this example

1287
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:51,615
So this is the little triangle thing in the back of the

1288
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:53,407
Does that matter

1289
01:13:54,175 --> 01:14:00,319
Okay how about explained all the weights we've got. We've got six years we've got.

1290
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:04,671
Virus have not explained every single light and know why is that

1291
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:06,975
Are only the one for 6

1292
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:09,023
Or Bible 7

1293
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:15,423
Was there a met every single waiting here and now we can run the dynamic going to buy it

1294
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:16,959
Set the bias to

1295
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:24,127
-8 + -5

1296
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:30,527
Please switch on wouldn't have that none of them would want to switch on adults

1297
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:36,927
Please my activation is plus I'd so you go ahead and switch your mom

1298
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:43,839
And then you ask you to do you want to switch on and he says my activation is plus one

1299
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:45,375
Yes I will switch on as well

1300
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:50,751
Not very good news cuz it's not going to be a presentation yet but we keep dying

1301
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:54,591
Da3 do you want switch on he says no way my activations - 6

1302
01:14:55,103 --> 01:15:01,247
Faithful always activations off in this Orange

1303
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:06,879
Does B101 switch on

1304
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:10,463
B2 says no leave me alone

1305
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:16,095
B302 we could toss a coin to decide whether to

1306
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:17,887
Top 10 mono knot

1307
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:18,911
I don't get a coin

1308
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:20,191
Okay

1309
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:24,543
Let's flip the coin

1310
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:29,407
Okay. That means that we don't turn it on

1311
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:30,175
All right

1312
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:36,575
I was a tale before do you want chicken he's alright that's how I feel

1313
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:38,623
Heads heads

1314
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:40,415
And don't go

1315
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:45,535
Write see why does it want to go on no it's stable

1316
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:51,935
Does si tu no it's stable the C3 it's unstable it wants to to go on it

1317
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:53,215
So that goes

1318
01:15:53,983 --> 01:16:00,127
C4 is stable D1 stable D2 is stable D3

1319
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:06,527
Stay with me. Now you keep on running it what you want to do

1320
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:09,599
What they want

1321
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:10,879
Stable stable

1322
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:12,927
Unstable okay

1323
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:14,463
Sable

1324
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:15,231
Sable

1325
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:16,511
Sable

1326
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:17,535
See

1327
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:18,815
Is stable

1328
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:22,655
C2 C3 C4

1329
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:23,423
Stable

1330
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:25,983
Unstable okay

1331
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:32,383
Unstable before stable back up the top one stable A2 unstable

1332
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:33,919
All right man

1333
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:35,455
Thanks table well

1334
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:36,223
B

1335
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:38,015
Stable stable stable

1336
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:45,439
You can be assured we're not going to be here forever because this thing is minimizing an objective function eventually will be

1337
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:47,231
60s table table

1338
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:48,511
Stable stable

1339
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:51,327
Stable stable

1340
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:53,119
StayWell I got anyone

1341
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:56,703
What you think is going to happen when it's unstable

1342
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:59,519
Okay they are all

1343
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:01,055
Stable happy bunnies

1344
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:03,615
So what's happened

1345
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:08,223
It has a plan and it's in a state that doesn't want me to pay attention

1346
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:13,087
That might actually be the optimal tour I can't remember you can check

1347
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:19,999
Okay so that's all Phil Network being used to solve a notarization points problem

1348
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:25,631
I Got Dirt don't be impressed by people who sometimes sold NP complete problems they can never do it reliably

1349
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:30,239
But that's an interesting thing to do with a neural network

1350
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:36,895
3ir who was a student in the engineering department are back in 91

1351
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:43,295
For his guy she said well let's take this is actually a bit broken to have an objective function That's a Some

1352
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:49,695
Overrule plus the thing you want to minimize update the way hoping that works work

1353
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:56,095
In such a way that we don't have a competition between Trying to minimize the distance on obeying the rules that he tweets

1354
01:17:56,351 --> 01:18:02,495
A little bit and came up with a Russian of this network optimization algorithm it's involved

1355
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:07,359
Continuous neurons that gradually got switched on it's like starting a high temperature state

1356
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:08,383
End up

1357
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:14,783
Reducing the temperature and here's a picture of his Network solving the traveling scholar problem which

1358
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:17,599
To the task of visiting all the Cambridge colleges

1359
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:20,159
So that was fun

1360
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:23,743
The final thing I want to say is

1361
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:30,399
And this is a personal story of how my understanding of neural networks evolved into something

1362
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:31,167
An useful

1363
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:38,079
Here's a question for you I've been working a lot I want you to talk to each other for a minute and say what is this from

1364
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:39,359
Healthy distribution

1365
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:41,407
Okay I have a chat to each other

1366
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:43,455
And see what you think it might be

1367
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:09,311
You're allowed to make hubbub

1368
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:11,103
Indeed I

1369
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:12,895
Would really like you to make Ava

1370
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:15,104
Could give you a possible hint I've grown on the bullet just now

1371
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:18,432
A graph associated with the function of written down that

1372
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:20,224
The graph contains

1373
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:22,016
At Square nose

1374
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:25,088
The song includes

1375
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:27,904
Attend

1376
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:31,488
That connects together multiplies

1377
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:34,048
The variables that are only

1378
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:37,120
How does a connected to that's a Preacher Man the song

1379
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:40,192
Is that black blob or a white blob

1380
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:41,984
And that white bulb is connected to the

1381
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:43,776
Times that a couple together

1382
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:45,312
Suck

1383
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:54,784
Okay answer is it's the graph of the 7/4

1384
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:56,064
Hamming code

1385
01:20:57,344 --> 01:21:02,720
So this probability distribution has what property if Peter is a big positive number

1386
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:03,744
What happens

1387
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,792
That means we favor

1388
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:10,400
States where X 1 * x 3 * x 3 x x 5

1389
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:12,448
Is equal to plus one

1390
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:14,752
And Parolees Act is a + -1 now

1391
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:19,872
So what happens if you were to perfectly simulate this probability distribution

1392
01:21:20,128 --> 01:21:21,664
Is Beatrice flight Lounge

1393
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,712
Which states would keep on coming out

1394
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:27,040
Yeah

1395
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:31,904
Okay

1396
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:38,048
What would keep on coming up would be States in which the parity of these four guys is even

1397
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:44,960
Find where the parking fees for is even in states where the parking fees for his even because then old full terms would be

1398
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:45,728
Plus one

1399
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:53,664
I'm what's another name we give to State a Conex to at 3:07 that have the property

1400
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,456
The parity of these for

1401
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:56,224
Is even

1402
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:59,552
On the property visit even these is even

1403
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:03,136
Those states are

1404
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:11,840
They all the code words of the seven for having code so this is the graph of a sudden.

1405
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:12,864
Mission on the board

1406
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:13,632
Is

1407
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:19,008
The probability distribution that sits with lots of mass all over the code words

1408
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:20,032
Symmetrically

1409
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:23,872
And assigns very little Mass to known code words

1410
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:25,152
I think

1411
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:30,784
So this hasn't gone anywhere it's just an observation that probability distribution

1412
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:33,344
Which is a sum of

1413
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:35,136
Simple terms

1414
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:37,184
That probability distribution

1415
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:41,024
Is the probability distribution of the sensible code within the human code

1416
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:43,328
So question 2

1417
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:44,864
What is this

1418
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:07,648
Do I make hubba bubba gum

1419
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:12,512
I'm drawing the graph of this function for you

1420
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:17,120
And the question is what's the probability distribution

1421
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,080
The graph of the function

1422
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:32,480
Just involves simple times each time is b n x x

1423
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:35,552
Adding an extra node to each of these

1424
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:37,088
Variables

1425
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:40,416
Okay so what is this

1426
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:46,304
That's not good 3 and that's connected to what you saying

1427
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:53,472
I've got to find yes well. Thank you

1428
01:23:58,592 --> 01:24:00,896
Sorry about what is this

1429
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:03,200
Probability distribution what could it be

1430
01:24:07,552 --> 01:24:10,880
Okay so we added a by us to each bit

1431
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:17,280
And in what context might you get such biases and say yes this is an interesting probabilities

1432
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:28,800
Okay let me help

1433
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:30,336
So let's imagine

1434
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:33,152
But someone is sending code words

1435
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:39,040
Using a 7 full how many code so they spitting out tea and it goes over Channel

1436
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:40,832
Which is the binary symmetric Channel

1437
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:47,232
Which is received thing the diff is biking flips using a bench

1438
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:54,400
And you receive

1439
01:24:54,656 --> 01:25:00,800
I know you want to solve the problem of saying given our what do I think the code would wasn't that for what

1440
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:02,080
What was s

1441
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:03,616
Okay

1442
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:10,272
Saudia and coding operation was they picked a tee from the first distribution Circle at P North

1443
01:25:10,784 --> 01:25:11,808
So they used

1444
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:14,368
Peanuts

1445
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:21,024
Because we have not a clue with that they chose that's what they picked at random

1446
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:22,816
For my pain if you

1447
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:24,096
One of the code words

1448
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:26,656
So they threw tea from peanut

1449
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:30,496
Then we got an observation we get to see

1450
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:34,848
An hour is a noisy version of Tissot in terms of graphical model

1451
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:35,872
AR

1452
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:38,432
Gives you biases on each of the bits

1453
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:42,528
So the posterior probability

1454
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:44,064
Which is

1455
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:46,112
What you want for decoding

1456
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:49,696
Birthday probability all t

1457
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:56,096
Given is the product to be a given t x apply for the

1458
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:56,864
50

1459
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,400
Normalized

1460
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:01,984
This time here

1461
01:26:02,752 --> 01:26:06,336
Is penalty and this one is

1462
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:09,664
A product of time is one for each of the

1463
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:11,968
Bits to end

1464
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:14,784
All the probability of

1465
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:17,088
And given that TN

1466
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:20,160
Which you can write if you want as

1467
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:21,440
E2b

1468
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:22,464
B

1469
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:24,512
And

1470
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:25,280
X

1471
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:26,304
TN

1472
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:28,096
Give or take some

1473
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:32,704
All right

1474
01:26:33,728 --> 01:26:34,240
So

1475
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:36,032
The answer to question 2 is

1476
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:40,128
This probability distribution is the posterior probability

1477
01:26:40,384 --> 01:26:41,920
Of the code word

1478
01:26:42,176 --> 01:26:42,944
Given

1479
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,992
The output of a binary symmetric Channel

1480
01:26:46,272 --> 01:26:48,832
Not just a virus message Channel

1481
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:52,160
Any channel where each bit is independently

1482
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:53,696
Communicate

1483
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:55,488
Binary symmetric Channel

1484
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:58,560
Would be the special case where all of the ends is a

1485
01:26:58,816 --> 01:27:01,632
+ 2.70 - 2.70

1486
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:07,520
And it'll be the same body 2.7 repeated lots of times with pluses or minuses depending whether the alphabet is

1487
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:09,568
At 1 or 0

1488
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:15,456
If it's another Channel like a gaussian channels on bn's would be different from each other

1489
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:23,392
Apologies for the technical problem I'm going to have to re speak selection from here on Earth

1490
01:27:25,696 --> 01:27:28,768
So this observation that the

1491
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:30,560
Error-correcting

1492
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:36,960
Code decoding problem can be expressed in terms of a probability distribution which

1493
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:40,544
Upstairs an exponent is a sum of simple factors

1494
01:27:41,824 --> 01:27:43,616
On the observation that

1495
01:27:43,872 --> 01:27:46,432
The hopfield network can be viewed as

1496
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:48,224
An approximation

1497
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:53,088
To a probability distribution that is the exponential of a sum of

1498
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:54,624
Simple factors

1499
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:57,440
In the case of a hopfield Network these factors adjust

1500
01:27:57,696 --> 01:28:01,792
Quadratic with Turnpike wrj XIX J

1501
01:28:02,816 --> 01:28:04,096
Miss observation

1502
01:28:04,352 --> 01:28:05,888
Motivates the idea

1503
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:07,680
Maybe we could take

1504
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:11,520
The decoding problem of an error correcting code

1505
01:28:13,056 --> 01:28:14,080
And solve it

1506
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:15,872
Using approximate methods

1507
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:24,064
So I'm not just talking about the seven for having code but the idea is to generalize take

1508
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:28,160
Other Eric redeem codes Xpressbet decoding problems

1509
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:29,184
Amazon

1510
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:30,208
In terms of

1511
01:28:30,464 --> 01:28:31,744
E to the power

1512
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:34,048
Opus Olive simple factors

1513
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:36,352
And then use for example

1514
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:38,144
A variational method

1515
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:40,704
To approximate at distribution

1516
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:43,264
And hopefully find the maximum

1517
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:45,568
Off the bus 3 distribution

1518
01:28:48,128 --> 01:28:54,272
And in 1995 that's what I did I wrote a paper told free energy minimization algorithm

1519
01:28:54,528 --> 01:29:00,672
What decoding and cryptanalysis and I made some random simple error correcting codes

1520
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:03,232
And I decoded them

1521
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:07,328
Using variational methods very similar to

1522
01:29:07,584 --> 01:29:09,376
The Outfield Network we've been looking at

1523
01:29:13,472 --> 01:29:13,984
Feet

1524
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:15,776
Error-correcting codes I made

1525
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:18,336
Happy form of

1526
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:24,224
And identity Matrix on the right-hand side and on the left hand side just in space random ones

1527
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:28,064
Typical low-density generator Matrix codes

1528
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:32,160
And

1529
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:33,952
When that work

1530
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:40,352
Looked quite promising that the window record-breaking results from it but it was promising enough that I carried on

1531
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:43,424
Looking at this topic and discussed with Radford nail

1532
01:29:44,192 --> 01:29:45,216
The questions

1533
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:46,752
First

1534
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:52,640
Can we do better than variational free energy minimization as a decoding algorithm

1535
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:54,688
What coats like these

1536
01:29:55,200 --> 01:30:00,832
And secondly for what are regretting codes do they sort of spas

1537
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,624
Graph based

1538
01:30:03,392 --> 01:30:05,696
Message passing decoding algorithms

1539
01:30:05,952 --> 01:30:07,232
What the best

1540
01:30:07,488 --> 01:30:11,840
Which Eric redeem codes are best suited to these sort of algorithms

1541
01:30:16,448 --> 01:30:22,080
And what we found was that we could in fact do better than the racial free energy minimization

1542
01:30:22,848 --> 01:30:23,360
We

1543
01:30:23,872 --> 01:30:25,920
Rediscovered the idea of using

1544
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:32,320
An algorithm called the sumproduct algorithm which is also a message passing algorithm on a spacecraft

1545
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:38,720
And it also has a variational interpretation but it was a better algorithm than variation

1546
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:43,072
The second thing we did was we

1547
01:30:43,328 --> 01:30:48,704
Try to invent new Eric redeem codes and we invented a range of error correcting codes

1548
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:56,896
All of which are better than these low-density generator Matrix code then some of them are quite a girl

1549
01:30:57,152 --> 01:31:02,016
And the very best ones that we came up with were actually first invented

1550
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:04,064
In 1962

1551
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:10,464
Bob Gallagher who is one of the founding fathers of information Theory along with Shannon and others

1552
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:14,304
Invented low-density Parts check codes for his PhD thesis

1553
01:31:15,072 --> 01:31:16,096
And in

1554
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:19,424
1996 Radford Kneeland I wrote a paper

1555
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:23,008
Showing that you could not achieve nishine Unlimited Performance

1556
01:31:23,264 --> 01:31:25,312
With these recruiting codes

1557
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:26,848
To remember

1558
01:31:27,104 --> 01:31:29,152
Back in like the one we discussed

1559
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:30,176
The

1560
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:37,088
Diagram of performance of Eric writing coach with right along the horizontal axis and error probability on the bus glass

1561
01:31:37,344 --> 01:31:43,488
Texas we had repetition codes that went very good we had some other codes like the 74 Hyman code

1562
01:31:43,744 --> 01:31:45,024
Better

1563
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:47,584
And we had this remarkable result from Shannon

1564
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:52,960
Which is that there exists a recruiting codes then that can achieve

1565
01:31:53,472 --> 01:31:59,616
Rates anywhere up to the capacity with error probability arbitrarily small

1566
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:05,504
And rebate

1567
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:08,320
Lotus two-party check codes which

1568
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:10,624
AR

1569
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:17,024
Very similar to load it to generator Matrix codes but they look like this instead of

1570
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:17,792
Having

1571
01:32:20,352 --> 01:32:22,144
Part of The Matrix

1572
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:25,728
Peace Paws and part of it and identity Matrix

1573
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:27,264
The whole Matrix

1574
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:28,544
Is spas

1575
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:32,384
With three ones McCollum three wants to come all the way across

1576
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:38,784
Or it could be some other number like 405 but the results I'm about to show you three ones McCollum

1577
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:47,232
And so here on the screen you can see a price check Matrix with

1578
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:53,888
20000 columns and 10,000 roads and if you look very closely you'll see that there are three ones in every single way

1579
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:56,704
Opos 20000 columns

1580
01:32:57,728 --> 01:32:59,264
The picture on the top right

1581
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:00,544
Chose you

1582
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:04,896
I transmitted Vector which consists of 10000 bits set

1583
01:33:05,152 --> 01:33:05,664
Bye

1584
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:12,064
The use up that's the top half of that transmitted image and then the ten thousand

1585
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:13,344
Party Shack beds

1586
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:18,208
Which are set in such a way that over 10,000 constraints in the park check Matrix

1587
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:22,048
Have the 10,000 constraints defined by the fire chat Matrix

1588
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:23,584
All satisfied

1589
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:26,144
And when you send

1590
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:27,168
That

1591
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:28,960
Overchannel

1592
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:31,264
The

1593
01:33:35,104 --> 01:33:35,616
Received

1594
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:38,176
That cut

1595
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:44,832
Looks like what we see in this next slide hair this is a binary symmetric Time on Netflix 7.5% of the bits

1596
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:49,696
And the animated gif that we will insert here somehow

1597
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:51,232
Shows

1598
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:53,024
The decoding

1599
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:53,792
Of

1600
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:55,584
This particular

1601
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:57,120
Received

1602
01:33:57,376 --> 01:34:00,704
It takes about 15 Inspirations for the sum product algorithm

1603
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:01,984
To figure out

1604
01:34:03,008 --> 01:34:05,056
What the correct state was

1605
01:34:05,824 --> 01:34:10,944
And the animated gif Loops through a few times during the decoding process

1606
01:34:14,016 --> 01:34:14,528
The

1607
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:22,208
Performance of this particular error-correcting code which has raped on her for the binary symmetric Channel with a flip

1608
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:24,000
The probability of 7.5%

1609
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:26,304
Is shown in the right hand side of his slime

1610
01:34:28,096 --> 01:34:31,936
It has another probability a little bit smaller than one intent of a five

1611
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:34,496
And that's

1612
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:37,312
Quite close to the Shannon limit which is a bit bigger than

1613
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:39,104
A rate of 1/2

1614
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:44,992
And it's much closer to the Shannon limit than any of these textbook codes which is shown by the pluses

1615
01:34:45,248 --> 01:34:45,760
In the figure

1616
01:34:47,552 --> 01:34:51,392
And this rediscovery of Shannon's learning CPR cheat codes

1617
01:34:51,648 --> 01:34:55,744
Had a significant impact on the field of information Theory and coding Theory

1618
01:34:56,256 --> 01:34:59,328
In 1997 there was

1619
01:34:59,584 --> 01:35:05,728
At the International Symposium on information Theory the big information Theory conference it was just a single diaper on load

1620
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:08,800
Tea party check coats namely the one by me and Richard Neal

1621
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:11,872
Five years later the same conference

1622
01:35:12,128 --> 01:35:18,272
Had six interceptions devoted to Lowden State Park 10 session

1623
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:19,552
Full of papers

1624
01:35:19,808 --> 01:35:22,112
Full on the topic of spacecraft codes Wichita

1625
01:35:22,624 --> 01:35:26,976
A code like these Lowden special codes defined in terms of spacecraft coats

1626
01:35:27,232 --> 01:35:31,328
Once it was established that you could get good performance from message passing algorithms

1627
01:35:31,584 --> 01:35:34,656
Sunspots crafts a whole industry was created

1628
01:35:34,912 --> 01:35:37,472
Inventing different sorts of spacecraft codes that

1629
01:35:37,728 --> 01:35:40,544
That could take advantage of message message passing

1630
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:45,408
So my intention here is to show you how

1631
01:35:46,176 --> 01:35:48,992
If you look out for connections

1632
01:35:49,248 --> 01:35:52,576
You can discover that everything is connected

1633
01:35:53,344 --> 01:35:55,904
I'd like to thank you very much for

1634

1
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:07,424
Falcon flight to 5

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,824
In the last lecture we defined symbol codes around theoretical and practical questions

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,104
About symbol codes

4
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:16,896
And

5
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:23,552
That gave us even more evidence for these claims which we've no proof sufficiently I'm going to take them

6
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:28,672
Trousseau the claim wasn't the right way to measure information content is with log

7
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:35,072
Base 2 of one of a p of an outcome that is not a measure of information

8
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:41,472
It is how many bits you should expect to be able to encode that out come into if you're using a good compression method

9
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:44,800
The enemy is the average of the information content

10
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:47,360
And the source coding theorem says

11
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:51,456
If you got a soul for them to pay hu kind of compress

12
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:54,016
And I'll come 210h bits

13
00:00:54,528 --> 00:01:00,672
We looked at symbol codes we're without punctuation you give binary string strings of zeros and

14
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:05,536
The ones to each letter in your alphabet and we established

15
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:09,376
Some theoretical results of some of them without proof

16
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:16,032
So we came to an understanding of how unique dakotabilities constrains the length to come make a

17
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:22,432
Really short you have to if you make some length show that you have to make other length of your code words longer

18
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,480
We

19
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:30,880
It's just a notion of prefix codes that are easy to decode codes that are associated with binary tree's

20
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,440
I'm noticed that

21
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:39,584
If you had Cody length equal to the information content then you got the best possible compression and the average length

22
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,376
Pause symbol with entropy

23
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:47,776
And we stated without proof that with the optimal symbol code you can get with anyone bit

24
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,568
All of the entropy

25
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,128
And finally we

26
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,176
So the Huffman algorithm

27
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:59,552
Which is an algorithm extremely simple for making optimal symbol codes

28
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:03,392
So let's just recap plant with these examples

29
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:10,304
If the probabilities are

30
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:17,728
Huffman algorithm says combine the two split with smallest prevented hate you can take your pick

31
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,520
I give you 2/5

32
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,336
Combine the two with most probability

33
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:27,456
Can combine the two it's full again take your pick

34
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:35,904
And then combine these long and then by Putting Edge zeros in on the edges

35
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:43,328
We can Define codes this one is 0-0 this 101 coming on the tree

36
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,888
This is 100

37
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,680
This is why I'm there one

38
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,472
How this phone is

39
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,496
On one

40
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:53,568
Hwang what do I done wrong

41
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,224
Any questions

42
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:07,392
So let's do another example of the probabilities are proportional to 3/4

43
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,416
6

44
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,184
7

45
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,976
8

46
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,512
9

47
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,304
10

48
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,144
Hoffman says

49
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,936
Lyme disease

50
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:24,544
I'm combine these two six and combine these two got nine

51
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,408
And take the two sixes and you get 12

52
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:34,272
Then seven of the eight to make 15

53
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,320
Then what

54
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:39,904
Carefully retype the 2/9

55
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,232
18

56
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:48,096
Then who does 10 go with 10 goes with the 12

57
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,960
Introduce

58
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,312
And then the two smallest of 15 and 18

59
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:04,224
Stringy spit E350

60
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:09,856
And I slept on zeros and ones anyway you want and request a selfie optimal symbol code

61
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,648
Uncle by

62
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,696
Any questions

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,143
Yes sir the question was does the Huffman algorithm ensure that we got a prefix code and the answer is

64
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:26,495
Yes because when we put the labels on when making a binary tree

65
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,031
And

66
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:34,431
Where to find any code words from the root of the tree Atwoods what we will get is a prefix code there's no way

67
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:39,551
Play that one code word can be a prefix or another if that defined in terms of a binary tree

68
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:43,135
Algorithm always gives you a prefix code

69
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,439
And it's open

70
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:52,095
You can't make a vesa symbol code then wraps up

71
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:52,863
Impression

72
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:58,751
One thing you might ask Edition about prefix code is

73
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,799
Is it sufficient

74
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:07,199
To make a prefix code if someone said I've got a really coming idea I got to make a code that is not a prefix code

75
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:12,063
Then it's going to be back up can we prove that that is untrue

76
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,367
And the answer is

77
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:20,767
Yes we can prove it untrue by the following fairly simple argument imagine that someone has made a symbol code

78
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:27,679
Which they claim is wonderful and it's not the prefix code you say okay please tell me the length of all of y'all symbol codes

79
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:30,239
Starting with the shortest length

80
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:33,567
Up to the longest length give me them sorted by length

81
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:39,967
Then I'm going to go to the symbol code Supermarket which we introduced last time and I will walk across it

82
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:43,807
From one side to the other and I will buy the short skirt with first

83
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:50,207
And then having to move across to the next I'll buy some of the next length and so forth

84
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:52,255
With the shopping list that you have given me

85
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:57,119
As long as you have given me a shopping list that doesn't exceed the budget

86
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,423
The craft budget of Wong

87
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:02,239
Then I will be able to buy your lengths of

88
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,031
Of coats

89
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,359
And because I've stepped across

90
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:12,479
From one aisle to the next crossed maybe I should make clear what I mean so that I have to buy

91
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:18,879
To blank too many wanted wanted length free this one and then some rest

92
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,183
I would like for our biolase

93
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:28,863
As an example because I'm moving across and never overlapping with myself I'll end up with a prefix

94
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,631
Xcode

95
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:33,983
The only way you would violate the prefix property to the throne the same

96
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,519
Vertical coordinate

97
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,311
MySupermarket

98
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,335
All right

99
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,871
So

100
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:46,271
The Huffman algorithm is already ultimate it makes prefix codes so we didn't need to worry about this but it just in case

101
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:52,671
Play songs play me nah I want to do something clever not using prefix code well what's have expected length

102
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:58,303
They could have got with that non prefix code we can match that we can just replace that code by a prefix code

103
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:03,679
And the code I showed you for English hair was indeed

104
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:08,031
A code made with Huffman algorithm and it's a prefix code

105
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:17,759
So how we wrapped up compression by saying his how to make symbol codes on his how to make

106
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:24,159
Optional symbol codes for the rest of today I want to argue that we're not done with compression and the

107
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:27,999
It's because of this looking plus warm

108
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,047
High in the inequality

109
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,095
So

110
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,399
Are we done

111
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,679
No

112
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,871
Let me give you one really simple example

113
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:46,175
To justify this

114
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:51,295
An example we started with the band coin

115
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:57,695
Let's imagine we haven't been calling and it's two phases of cold A&B and let's say the high probabilities .99

116
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,975
1.01

117
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:05,375
And I compress it to using the symbol codes and you Catholic

118
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:09,471
Find the two symbols with smallest probability you can buy them in too long

119
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:15,871
Can you put labels on here and you say I will then code ia01 be as long as in that wonderful it's an optical

120
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:18,175
It's expected length

121
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,711
Is 1

122
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,759
And that is indeed

123
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:28,159
Close to the entropy which is 0.08 bits

124
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,951
Is within one bit of entropy

125
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:34,815
But it's actually about the Pac-12 bigger than the entropy

126
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:41,215
I just know depressing it's over cuz it's just taking a binary alphabet main coding it directly into binary

127
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:47,615
So that's a trivial example symbol codes for getting us where we really want to go

128
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:54,015
Simon says we should be able to achieve more than tenfold compression of that been calling file

129
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:58,879
So I'd like to know play a game with you

130
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,671
2

131
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:07,071
Help us understand the situations in which we might be dissatisfied about this plus one

132
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:10,143
That's looking in this

133
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,423
Inequality

134
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:12,959
So

135
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,287
The game is called the guessing game

136
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:20,639
But when I'm going to do is I'm going to write on the board

137
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,175
A headline

138
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:26,527
How many Cipher and I have to head line Roofing hair

139
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,063
In front of me

140
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,415
I don't get to write it with you I'll help

141
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:37,279
Because you're going to guess each letter of a headline as we go along

142
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:43,935
And if you guess the first letter correctly I'll write it down and I will tell you it's correct and then we can move on to the grass

143
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:44,959
II

144
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:45,983
Lhasa

145
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:50,335
All the headline alphabet of legal characters for this headline

146
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,383
Is on the board of ed

147
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,919
How to space

148
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:58,527
Remind me to finish the headline. I'll let you know so I'll Supply the

149
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,063
The.

150
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,367
The end of the headline

151
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,439
Okay

152
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:12,607
You can start guessing the first letter and I will right underneath this line all the guess is that you have made

153
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:17,215
That I'm not correct I'm going to right above the line it tells you that you've got the right left

154
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,495
So

155
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,775
Guessing time

156
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:25,663
Naughty naughty

157
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:29,503
Is not right

158
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,647
Keep guessing

Do you say a

Hey

164
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,943

00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:36,031
Thanks and I'll give you the and the father

220
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:39,359
Reasonably refusing to work after that day

221
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,943
So there's a headline

222
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:49,343
And it involves you acting as expert English speakers and using your

223
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,391
Knowledge about English to make predictions

224
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:56,255
I would like you to know shift some things about the predictions

225
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,047
You made

226
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,375
The first thing is

227
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:06,751
I think you are well aware that your predictive distribution the predictions you would make at any particular point

228
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,055
Change depending on the context

229
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:27,231
So for example the second letter of your predictions

230
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:27,999
Vowels

231
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,559
Because she was struggling to think of

232
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:36,191
Things that could have come after end but we're not valves be good at being an aunt or something strange like that

233
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,775
So that example

234
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:46,175
And it was a context where you predicted K as your first choice where eyes in the generic

235
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,967
Location you say things like tea

236
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,271
A insightful

237
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:53,087
Stop your predictions depending on the context

238
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,135
And

239
00:15:55,391 --> 00:16:01,535
That's because there are correlations in order English between the letters you are aware of what

240
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,327
Words and grammar insightful

241
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,119
So

242
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:12,799
I'm asking a question what's wrong with single codes we could just use the Huffman algorithm if we used it one side only

243
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:17,151
Play end of May the optimal Huffman code for the English alphabet

244
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,431
It wouldn't

245
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,991
Correspond to a changing probability distribution

246
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:27,647
How can we fix that well in principle you could fix that by saying let's run the Hoffman every time

247
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:33,535
So we'll have some soda process that emulates your expertise when we get to a particular context

248
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,559
We could

249
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:40,191
Then compress the next character using the probability distribution that is optimal for that contact

250
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:46,335
I make the Ultima single code and then send the appropriate next three bits or two bits or one bit

251
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:51,455
And the person on the receiving end could emulate. Process all also

252
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,991
Figuring out which

253
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:57,087
Huffman code which symbol code you are about to use for every kinda

254
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,903
They could do that but that sounds a bit of a fast

255
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,863
There is a problem

256
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:15,007
Which is that if the predictions are very precise you'll still be spending one bit for every character

257
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:22,431
So I'll write it down in just that I went what's my second issue my second issue is

258
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:25,247
That the context-dependent predictions

259
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:30,367
Volta change as you learn about

260
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:34,207
The style of the document that you'll compressing

261
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:54,687
They change we didn't really see this but the headline because it wasn't a very long document but if I'd said yeah his a headline

262
00:17:54,943 --> 00:18:01,087
Started off and I said right after you made a lot of gas

263
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:07,487
May Fahrenheit for a haiku Katana way you would have realized it wasn't an English headline

264
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:12,607
He would have been started learning about the predictive distributions that are appropriate for Swahili

265
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,399
So

266
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:23,103
Early on you might not know Swahili very well as you get to the end of a very long document you would have started learning the phrase

267
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:29,503
Phrases and words of Swahili

268
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:34,367
He's repeating this this long that again let's try using that for a predictions

269
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:38,975
So the predictions change in the sense that they become

270
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,815
More precise

271
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,863
And refined

272
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,703
As you get data

273
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,775
Nothing is what I just said a moment ago

274
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:55,615
Austin the predictions you make all very confident

275
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:58,431
And this is the most important

276
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,711
Taxable

277
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:05,343
Open your predictive distribution

278
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:11,231
Is there a

279
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,047
And we could

280
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:18,911
Confirm this just by keeping track of how many letters you

281
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:21,471
Got first time or

282
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:35,295
So let's count up how many guesses you made before you go to the correct one so hey you made five

283
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:38,879
Casas can you see that on the camera

284
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:45,023
All right tell you made one to do

285
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,047
5

286
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:53,215
So at the beginning of the beginning of a phrase it's quite hard to predict what's going on

287
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:58,079
Free manga

288
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:00,383
3 again at the beginning of

289
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,663
And one

290
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:07,039
Fan 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

291
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:13,439
At the beginning of the word whoops sorry I ate 9 10 11 is what I mean

292
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,743
11 guesses to get there

293
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:21,887
3D and then it got a long long long long day

294
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:26,751
1 2 3 4 5 1 1 1 1

295
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:30,079
Time had one two three four five six seven eight

296
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:35,967
And I want you to and one one

297
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,271
For 3

298
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,063
Juan lawn mower

299
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:46,719
That would have been fairly extraordinary if you'd have so many warnings in that if it would actually the case that you really work

300
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:53,119
Quite certain about those particular predictions I didn't elicit from you exactly how show you

301
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:59,519
So we could have gone through some process of figuring out your own money and that sort of thing

302
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:02,847
Suck

303
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,383
Often

304
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:07,711
It's the case that the next data is highly predictable

305
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:11,551
So what am I saying I'm saying typical

306
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,623
Context

307
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,928
Dependent prediction

308
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:24,096
That we could then feed into the Huffman algorithm for example

309
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:31,008
Look something like this they'll be some letters that are not very likely there's the one letter that you're pretty damn sure

310
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:34,592
What is going to happen which maybe has 99% of the mass

311
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:40,992
MLB allotted by Velazquez which have very small probability so maybe

312
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:47,392
Your predictive distribution look something like this

313
00:21:54,048 --> 00:22:00,192
So here's a cartoon of a predictive distribution that

314
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:03,264
Has 10 letters

315
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,640
Those are possible but not very likely and one that has 99% of the mass

316
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:17,344
Let's run the Huffman algorithm on this should you do quick and at the end

317
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,416
You combine this with all of the others

318
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:21,696
I got

319
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:28,608
And that gives you your optimal symbol code if we were insisting on using symbol Coast the lengths you will get

320
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:32,192
Has to be bigger than one bit the expected length cuz every

321
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:38,848
Code in a symbol code is at least one bit long yet the ends of this distribution

322
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:41,664
A bit like the bank calling me earlier

323
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:44,736
Is .11 thanks

324
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:49,600
So what's the fundamental problem with a symbol code

325
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,928
If you's a symbol code

326
00:22:57,024 --> 00:23:01,888
You're obliged to a Mets

327
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:07,776
At least one bit

328
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,312
Soft character

329
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:12,640
I'm at lousy because the entropy

330
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:16,224
May often be much smaller than one bit the character

331
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,528
I have to do this

332
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,808
Even

333
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:23,648
Entropy is much smaller than one

334
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:38,240
No one I did for coping with the situation is this I all will I do love

335
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,520
So I wasn't meaning to run

336
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,544
Microsoft

337
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,080
All right next to the back

338
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,552
Instead

339
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:57,952
Abusing helping codes in this dumb way I could try and be a bit smarter you could say let's and code

340
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,232
Skagit artists together

341
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:05,888
And I could take any kinds of the time and say I can kill off this problem of Wong symbol

342
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:11,264
Lights Out by having blocks of six characters of the time

343
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,616
Home a B16 time cuz it's high and then I'll list all possible

344
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,664
Blocks of 16 characters

345
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,504
I'm asked the audience what the probability of all

346
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:27,392
50 ^ 16 sequences of length 16

347
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:30,208
Alphabet song of size 50

348
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:34,048
And then we can use the Huffman algorithm to incur the blocks

349
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:40,448
So you could say let's think in terms of runs because I how many runs of one

350
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:46,848
Father in heaven we could ask the origin to predict how long do you think you'll get ones for before you got it wrong

351
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:52,224
How can I ask you for bets on that number how long the run is

352
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:58,624
And that will give us an integer that was 0 and it was

353
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:05,024
And then there was a run at like 3 and then with three catches answer. We could do encode into a different alphabet

354
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,072
What we talk about run lengths

355
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:11,168
And then use the Huffman algorithm

356
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,704
But maybe

357
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:19,872
We're finding it's a little bit complicated I'm maybe we like to move on and say that was a better way than symbol coats and that's the message

358
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:20,896
Picture of a slapshot

359
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:23,200
Sir

360
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:30,624
If you would to do what I just described for dumpling coding blocks of car do you have to compute lots more

361
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,232
Joint probability if we got up to this point I was being saying to you

362
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:41,632
Okay if not tell me what do you think the next five characters might be guess the next 5K

363
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:54,432
For the next five characters which you would have to actually compute even though only one of those 5

364
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:59,552
Time to sequences is actually going to happen so you would have to think about many more possibilities

365
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,112
So in summary

366
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,440
What we would like is a solution

367
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,976
But they took compression

368
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,024
Where we can use

369
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,816
Context-dependent

370
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:13,888
Adaptive probabilistic models

371
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:17,984
So do you want to allow contact dependents you want to laugh at a detention

372
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,776
And we want

373
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:23,872
To be able to handle very concentrated probability distributions

374
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:27,456
Start his whistle right

375
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,296
We want the method that can handle

376
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:36,416
Context-dependent

377
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,720
Adaptive

378
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,584
Probabilistic

379
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,400
Models

380
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:50,752
That we want to use

381
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,848
And

382
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,176
We want to get rid

383
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:03,808
Office symbol code gap between L&H

384
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:09,952
By handling strong system distributions well

385
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,512
Okay

386
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:19,936
I'm about to tell you how to solve this problem but first let's just think of something we can do with this bullet before we

387
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:20,704
Do I piss off

388
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,496
There's a game we can play

389
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:26,848
I'm going to write down the green integers on a piece of paper

390
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:33,248
So how many guests did you need for v v

391
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:37,856
5 for the next five for the next three one one one

392
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:38,624
3

393
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,392
Wang

394
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:43,744
11311 1 + 7

395
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:48,352
And I could write down those integers on a piece of paper

396
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,168
And now

397
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,984
These integers

398
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,056
Contain enough information to reconstruct the headline

399
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:58,336
So top

400
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:04,224
Imagine that there is another lecture theater identical to this one

401
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,040
Identical in the sense that it's going to lecture in the front

402
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:13,696
Here's my identical twin and all of you and Alexa are also there in the form of identical twins

403
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:20,096
The same thoughts beliefs and predictions only post this through the wall into the other

404
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:26,496
I know I come in unless we just talked about symbol codes and now we're going to play a guessing game

405
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:30,848
Thank you very much I'll miss this a paper here

406
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:37,248
Okay I'll go to headline uses this alphabet please stop guessing

407
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:43,648
You make guesses and you say t

408
00:28:54,912 --> 00:29:01,056
Abide nice stopping you whenever you guess the right number because we're perfect identical twins

409
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:02,592
Of the next election

410
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,616
Santa

411
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:10,016
We would end up writing down exactly the same set of letters on the board we will go through the same reasoning process

412
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:11,296
End up with hyponic

413
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:18,208
Okay so that's a fun idea that we couldn't quite Implement because

414
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:24,608
Identical twins but it's an of all state-of-the-art compressor

415
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:31,008
Can algorithms that you arrange to have identical twins of the two ends and those identical twins run for

416
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:37,152
This context-dependent adaptive probabilistic modeling in software

417
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:49,696
The question is are we assuming that it's a deterministic universe of the identical twins would exactly replicate

418
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:56,096
Yes for the verses of today the universe is actually deterministic and your identical twins would behave

419
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:57,120
Exactly the same as you

420
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:59,168
That's the analogy on I'm assuming

421
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,448
Okay

422
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:04,800
For this to work in real life we need to ensure that we have to do deterministic

423
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:11,200
Computers so the Adaptive probabilistic model that I'm talking about Willie a computer program

424
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:17,600
The try to emulate an expert audience like you and we will have one copy of that program

425
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,136
Encoding

426
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:25,536
Computer will have exactly identical deterministic on another computer that will work in exactly the same

427
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:29,120
I'm way so that we can replicate your guesses in your predictions

428
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:32,448
Okay so how do we do that

429
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:37,824
Well first I'm going to introduce encoding method called arithmetic coding

430
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,104
And

431
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:40,896
Out

432
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:46,016
Introduce it to you using several toy examples

433
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:49,856
One of which will be the the whole identical twin

434
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,696
Scenario it will start with slightly sinful

435
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,000
Examples

436
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:12,640
So let's give us those three tasks tasks

437
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:14,688
Then the general

438
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:17,248
Design that we have on the border

439
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:23,904
That's simpler but I have the essence all the problems are grappling with

440
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:30,560
We might have a bent coin with probabilities a b

441
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:35,168
Equal to 9.0

442
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:45,152
So we already know that symbol codes struggle with this we have to do something clunky with symbol codes to

443
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:46,432
Get any compression

444
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:47,968
The band coin

445
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,320
The second example

446
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,856
I will discuss

447
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,416
Is going to be the unknown

448
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:03,328
10 coin so I could tell you look I go to been calling in my pocket

449
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:07,680
It has been used to generate a great big file of A's and B's

450
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:13,312
I'm at so I'm telling you I don't know what the bias is but you do know that it's a biased coin

451
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,848
You just don't know

452
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,688
What Pa and PB

453
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:19,968
Oh yes

454
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:26,880
Another last on the Fly I want you to stop predicting just like that the headline you didn't know what language were in

455
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:33,536
Didn't know what it was about as we went along on the Fly you started to figure out what it was

456
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:41,216
So I don't know who's been calling so typical outcome might be lots of eggs in just a few bezoar

457
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:46,336
Or it might be lots of bees in just a few days and you don't know in advance which of those is going to be the case

458
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,200
And the third testicle discussed is the general

459
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:55,552
Situation where an article is available

460
00:32:56,576 --> 00:33:02,720
The Oracle job is given any context X1 X2 X3

461
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:05,792
60 - 1

462
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:12,448
The Oracle will supply you with the probability of the next character which you should assume is be

463
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:15,520
Correct distribution for the next character

464
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:21,920
And that will be an identical twin Oracle at the other end who will produce exactly the same distribution in response

465
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:25,248
That same context

466
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,552
So this is any context

467
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:33,952
And then the question is how should you compress when you got that Oracle

468
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:40,352
Now the article is actually a complete completely general statement of the compression problem

469
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:41,632
Could be

470
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:49,056
Produced by the article he just ignores it contacts me says a has probability 99%

471
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:53,152
The Oracle has the trivial cases in it as well

472
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:56,736
The way the article would do the been calling thing is

473
00:33:56,992 --> 00:34:03,136
Given the context he would look at how many A's and B's would have happened he would make an inference of what I think PA

474
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:09,536
Npb might be uncertainty about PA and PB in making his next prediction

475
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:15,936
Weather I think the next one is an IRB so he's first guess with no context

476
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:22,336
It could be blast as obese I don't know so be 50/50 then when you season a

477
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:24,384
For it being biased towards

478
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:29,760
Get a slightly bigger probability today and his identical twin would behave in exactly the same way

479
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:36,672
Okay so that's the three tasks that we want to solve and

480
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:39,232
Now we are going to

481
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,256
Define

482
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:42,304
Arithmetic coding

483
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:53,824
I should mention in passing the arithmetic coding is not the only other way of doing data compression apart from symbol code

484
00:34:54,080 --> 00:35:00,224
But in my view it's the only other one that is really worth devoting Electra to Durham any other algorithm summer

485
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,600
Arithmetic coding is is the king of compression

486
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:11,232
So do feel free to leave read the the textbook on the other

487
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,256
Depression meds

488
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:14,560
Stop this harassment coating works

489
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:18,400
Arthur the coding is based on this idea

490
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,680
That

491
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:22,240
You can do any transmission

492
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:27,616
In a binary

493
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:29,920
Alphabet

494
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:32,992
As defining an interval on the real line

495
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,792
Suck

496
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:49,120
Vera Wang for example

497
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:51,936
Is a little binary string

498
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:58,592
And you can view that as far as funding to the interval from no point to 525 in decimal

499
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:05,504
100 we can associate with the Note 5

500
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:11,648
Turn off my 6 to 5 what would doing it's worth taking the symbol coating supermarket

501
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,184
Hair

502
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:14,976
And viewing

503
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:21,888
The top of the supermarket is being the real number 0 on the bus

504
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:25,472
And any particular interval you can see 01

505
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:30,848
Lives that goes from quarter of the way down the supermarket shut down the supermarket

506
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:31,616
All right

507
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:32,640
So we just

508
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:33,664
Taking the soup

509
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,504
The supermarket literally as a real line

510
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:45,696
And something you can notice about the supermarket is as you go to the right if you lengthen a string from Sage

511
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:48,000
Is there a long 2 0 1 0

512
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:52,096
The interval associated with that lengthen string is a sub interval

513
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:54,400
Of the NW started

514
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,168
Trump

515
00:36:55,424 --> 00:37:01,568
So as you lengthen a binary string your old lady finding a sub until you're even having this way or this way

516
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:06,944
Hahahahahahaha inside the place you were before

517
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:14,624
So what are you saying

518
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,928
Was saying that you could imagine

519
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:21,280
Any binary file having a little dots on the front of it

520
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:23,840
Call the decimal point or a binary point

521
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,632
And then

522
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:27,680
The remaining characters

523
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:32,288
The binary expansion of a real number

524
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:39,200
So for example

525
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:43,296
Anyone megabyte file

526
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:49,696
Which begins o 100

527
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:53,536
4-H

528
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:56,864
Chameleon

529
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:04,288
Annie met one megabyte file defines a single real number where the Precision of at 8

530
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:07,872
Million binary digits or two million decimal places

531
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:11,456
Anyone megabyte file defines

532
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,368
A real number to roughly

533
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,928
2 million

534
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:23,744
Decimal places

535
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,304
High-precision nephew

536
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:31,680
Add another megabyte to Binary to it you defined it to another 2 million decimal places

537
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:36,544
Sony entire file is sending just the wrong number

538
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:42,176
So what we need to do next well

539
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:45,248
We're going to use the probabilities

540
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:48,320
Produced by our model

541
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:51,904
Which is either the been calling the unknown been calling or the auricle

542
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:59,584
We're going to use the probabilities from r

543
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,888
Adoptive

544
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:05,472
Context-dependent probabilistic model

545
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,544
To subdivide

546
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,640
The current interval

547
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:18,784
And initially the car and then to vote will be in hole from 0 to Wong

548
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:25,440
I will ask a probabilistic model what's the probability of a b and c and it might say four

549
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,488
42.5%

550
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:33,120
42.5% and 15% hopefully those that up to a hundred

551
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,448
For a b and c

552
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:43,360
How many say thank you very much I'm not going to ask you given that the first character in the file was actually a b

553
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:49,760
Please tell me the probability of the possible characters in that context and then we will subdivide

554
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:53,600
Stop printable recursively using the probabilities

555
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:55,392
But come from our

556
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:57,696
Expert from Oracle

557
00:39:57,952 --> 00:40:01,024
So let's show you this now

558
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:33,024
Alright so here we have a little Gizmo

559
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,864
With two real and holes in it and I are the same relatable

560
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:40,192
And we can subdivide them in binary

561
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:43,520
I'm sorry I'm sorry

562
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:47,104
So there's a simple coding Supermarket appearing

563
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:53,248
And we can pick any probabilistic model you won't at least within reason

564
00:40:54,272 --> 00:41:00,416
And use it to subdivide this world using the probabilities which have a 42 and 1/2

565
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:03,488
Send see 15%

566
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:04,512
And

567
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:08,096
If we're dealing with a fixed bent coin

568
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:11,424
Orfix probability distribution you can keep a fixed

569
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,240
Probability and subdivide

570
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:21,152
Hays interval using the same forward as he's a PC because we do that be subdivided into

571
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:23,456
C divided in the same way

572
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:24,992
Hand Circle

573
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,808
So you can

574
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:32,416
Identify on the left hand side if you if someone's giving you a file

575
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:35,232
You can ask the Oracle for the probabilities

576
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:40,352
And then you can identify the individual associated with the file would have to happen

577
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:46,240
Simile on the right hand side you can then hunt around and to find a binary string

578
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:50,592
Lines up pretty much exactly with the interval

579
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:51,872
On the left hand side

580
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:56,223
And then the method of encoding is going to be

581
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:57,247
Fat

582
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:09,279
We encode the entire file

583
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:16,447
Not just one character the whole file the whole file X switches the first time

584
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:19,775
II said that the end which could be

585
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,311
Millions of characters in length

586
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:23,359
Green Cove interfile

587
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:25,919
By transmitting

588
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:30,271
A binary string

589
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:36,415
Presentable lies

590
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:39,231
Within

591
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:44,863
The sauce strings interval

592
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:54,335
So

593
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:01,759
In very simple case where the entire string would just be followed by sea

594
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:07,391
That binary string we would find out subdivide and subdivide again

595
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:11,231
And then subdivide again either this way or this way

596
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:15,839
And we find ourselves a binary string how about

597
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:18,655
Slatwall

598
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:24,543
Stop binary string lights fully inside that envelope so we couldn't could be C

599
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:25,567
As

600
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:30,943
Skip Russell some zeros

601
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:34,015
1 zeros and ones

602
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:35,551
Sarah's ones

603
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:38,367
It's getting encoded as

604
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,647
Wang

605
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,951
1

606
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,999
000

607
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:45,535
All right

608
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:47,839
Find

609
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:54,239
I emphasize we do this for the entire file when you got the entire file you find a binary interval and so you fly

610
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:58,847
My one great Longbine restring his info lies inside

611
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:06,015
The corresponding 1/2 let's do this for the bent coin so let's give us

612
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:10,111
Event coinless reduce the alphabet size tutu

613
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:13,695
And let's say that the probabilities

614
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:16,255
Oops

615
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:22,911
The probabilities could be fixed to be

616
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:25,727
Say no .9

617
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:27,263
And

618
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:30,847
2.1 SAR to find my

619
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:33,151
Language model to be

620
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:34,687
The first task

621
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:35,967
Bent coin

622
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:39,551
And we revisit this

623
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:44,927
How are you doing

624
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:53,119
So now I'm using the been calling

625
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:55,423
I like to imagine what will happen

626
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:56,447
Is

627
00:44:56,959 --> 00:45:01,311
Aaba

628
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:04,639
We'll talk about the details

629
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:11,039
All exactly how you terminate files of the late today I just want to show you where we find that info so in the

630
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:13,087
Left on side reviews a b

631
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:16,671
Subdivide how we can keep on using that on the right we've got

632
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:19,231
Only by near Landrum.

633
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:23,327
How to buy a b into a AAA

634
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:26,143
And then going to be

635
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:32,031
I'm a guy is it easy and then head we got hostiles to mores

636
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:33,055
And

637
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:37,407
So is the individual ignorance from that to that I'm on the right hand side

638
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:39,199
His binary land

639
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:43,039
And resume Den in exactly the same way and Vineland

640
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:45,087
And so this string hair

641
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:50,719
Is the solo thing wrapped and if we keep on going just keep on getting us out more A's and B's

642
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:55,327
You can see how the string on the left hand side is getting long

643
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:56,607
It's not a golf

644
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:01,471
About a hundred characters in it

645
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:03,519
Ijh

646
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:10,431
Something nice to Kya cousin on the right we've got the corresponding binary string

647
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:12,991
Which is only about 48

648
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:17,343
It's long what we achieved but I chose to compression

649
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,623
What's the entropy

650
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:19,647
All

651
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:26,047
No .9 nobody

652
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:30,911
So we are achieving the compression that Shannon said we should be able to achieve

653
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:36,287
We're reducing the number finder contest by about a pack of tooth for this mankind

654
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:39,871
All right what about the been calling with an unknown

655
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:40,895
Bias

656
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:48,063
Wicked

657
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:50,879
Say that we don't know the probability

658
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:59,327
Soft press the button cool while it says

659
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:05,727
What should we got to start off with well it's 50/50 cuz we don't know the price of the Bitcoin but one through CNA then

660
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:08,799
Makes it slightly more likely that will CNAs the next

661
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:09,567
How come

662
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:15,967
Because it could be a strongly by a spine or it could still be in type of bees but that's unlikely proposition

663
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:21,087
And so let's imagine that aaba happens

664
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:25,183
So as we keep on going into

665
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:30,815
This is to Ace this is three days in a row

666
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:32,607
4 days in a row

667
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:34,399
And then we get house I was Abby

668
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:40,031
Zoom in a little bit

669
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:41,567
Oops too much

670
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:46,175
I can't say his the three days

671
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:47,967
Hanabi I think

672
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:49,503
How many drinks for a movie

673
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:50,527
Thanks

674
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:57,695
So here's our adoptive model using probability that depend on the context and let's imagine having put

675
00:47:57,951 --> 00:48:04,095
For a reason to be so that it's looking like you just keep on going

676
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:08,447
He was actually the improbable character and so you keep on going

677
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:14,847
I need a self a little B B and B C what happened to the predictive distribution

678
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:15,871
Hyper Beast

679
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:19,711
Even though Elian it look like he was the winner

680
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:22,271
We got lots of bees and we end up

681
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:26,111
Devoting more of the real line to bees

682
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:28,927
And that means that the binary string is getting shorter

683
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:32,767
Okay so we can do unlimited coins

684
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:37,375
And we can do oracles as well so let's rewind

685
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:44,799
So let's give us an English language model so I walked the first character going to be

686
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:48,639
Has a door space Sorry totaling to box in his a to zed

687
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:49,407
And his

688
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:55,807
Find reliant on the right-hand side as normal and let's say that we have the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog

689
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:59,647
I got the

690
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:00,671
Quick

691
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:09,375
Cute notes after the Q the language mobile says I've Just Seen A Q so you must be very probable

692
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:16,287
I was debating about half of the probability distribution to to you that's the sort of article what it looks like

693
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:22,687
Text and modifies the predictions accordingly

694
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:29,087
Because I try and face on a Linux back and how's the weather

695
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:31,903
So that's why that's the second most Pro Bowl character

696
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:35,487
Answer quick

697
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,839
Quick

698
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:46,751
Brown fox and so forth

699
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:53,151
Zoe zoom in on the left-hand side and on the right hand side tied to it is a binary world and

700
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:56,991
And if you. Send that binary string to someone at the other end

701
00:49:57,503 --> 00:50:03,647
They start with exactly the same tool in exactly the same state and they just need to memorize 110-0111

702
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:04,927
Etc

703
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:07,999
Which icon do

704
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:08,767
Oops

705
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,095
So

706
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:15,167
Reinitialize the tool in exactly the same state

707
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:21,311
And we going what was the message it was 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 Andre total into that

708
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:23,615
1100

709
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:28,735
Wan Wan Wan and so forth and on the right hand side you can see the quick brown fox

710
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:34,111
Should indeed be coming out because we got identical twin pieces of software at the two ends

711
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:36,671
So that those Metal Coating

712
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:39,487
Suck

713
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:41,535
Let's emphasize

714
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:44,351
How wonderful alphabet coding is

715
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:47,679
Dressers Outlet

716
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:48,703
We should

717
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:54,591
Give evidence for is that this really is almost optimal

718
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:55,871
Suck

719
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:57,151
Let me

720
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:59,967
Write down a feeling for you

721
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:04,831
The length of that binary string

722
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:12,255
But I just mentioned a few minutes ago for the one that we send the length of that binary string

723
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:19,167
Satisfies this the length of the encoding of X12 X-Men

724
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:21,215
It's less than or equal to

725
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:27,103
The sun information content which is what Shannon says it ought to be

726
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:31,199
But absolutely perfect impression is less than or equal to that + 2

727
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:38,111
So the entire length of the whole compressed file is only two bits longer than the optimal

728
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:40,927
Lights that shine would like you to have

729
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:47,071
And something to really emphasize that is what you compare that with what we could do a symbol codes for symbol codes

730
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:51,423
The lengths that you got stuck character was with when warm of the entropy

731
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:57,567
So that means a possible overhead on a file with an characters in it could be as big as an

732
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,847
I never had a van

733
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:05,247
We could be enormous this is for the entire file

734
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:07,295
Turn the overhead you get with symbol coats

735
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:15,231
Why is this the case what why is it that we end up with the optimal length well if you just say

736
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:20,095
Think about the subdivision process that we're going through the first

737
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:25,727
Isabel has a size equal to the probability of the first character given your model

738
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:32,383
Then you subdivide it in proportion to the probability of the second character given the

739
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:33,407
Fast car

740
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:34,943
His

741
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:41,343
The alphabet of possibilities and the product of those two is equal to the Joint probability of x

742
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:43,647
WiMAX to just buy trivial

743
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:45,695
Probability Theory

744
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:52,607
And then when you subdivide again you take that into a shoe size is X1

745
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:56,703
Connect to so I'll coffee this app when you subdivide

746
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:00,799
How do you say this is the probability of

747
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:06,687
You subdivide it in proportion to the probability of x3 given X1 and X2

748
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:09,247
If you multiply this length by that

749
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:11,295
Fraction you got

750
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:18,463
The probability of X1 X2 and X3 answer. The signs of the in

751
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:21,279
You got on the left hand side in the alphabet world

752
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:24,607
Is exactly the probability of the string

753
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:32,799
Not when you find a binary interval that lines up with that individual and it fits snugly inside

754
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:34,335
Perfectly snuggly

755
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:36,895
Then how many bits do you need

756
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:38,175
So that binary

757
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:44,575
Strength least time you start with 1 and 1/2 and 1/4

758
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:46,111
Who is the log base 2

759
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:51,231
All the size of the binary interval you end up with if it fits exactly snuggly

760
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:52,255
Then

761
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:56,351
The length of the binary string will be exactly equal to

762
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:58,399
The number factors of 2

763
00:53:59,167 --> 00:53:59,935
Baptist

764
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:02,751
Number hair it's more

765
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:03,519
Sanwa

766
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:05,823
Which is log base 2 of 1

767
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:08,383
First Knox

768
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:11,711
You will end up with a binary string of exactly the optimal length

769
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:18,879
In practice you weren't quite have a snug fit but it's an exercise in the book you can do that cuz I'm proof

770
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:24,767
In the worst-case the worst Norm snugfit you can end up with will be the the

771
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:30,143
Binary string is a factor of 4 smaller than the alphabet string

772
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:34,495
So you only need an extra two bits to be guaranteed that you found

773
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:36,543
A binary string that lives inside

774
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:38,335
Okay

775
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:39,871
Suck that

776
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:42,687
Fax number 1

777
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:44,991
Which is brilliant

778
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:51,391
And notes number to the other thing I want you to know is how much

779
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:53,439
What is it to do all this

780
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:59,071
What did we need to do did we need to think about all conceivable strings that could happen

781
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:01,887
No we only needed to think about

782
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:03,679
The probability of the first character

783
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:10,591
Then the probability of a second character given that particular first character that had actually happened then we need to think

784
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:14,431
Find the probability given the actual context of what happened

785
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:19,039
So the work required was only that's only

786
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:21,855
Needed to compute

787
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:24,671
End

788
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:31,071
Conditional probability back-to-school to describe it in terms of the actual probabilities if I is it

789
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:31,839
Website

790
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:36,447
We only have to compute and

791
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:37,983
Times online

792
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:39,775
Conditional probabilities

793
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:50,015
And then we just have to do a load of zooming and bit shifting in order to keep track of the arithmetic

794
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:56,671
So that's a lot less work than the methods we were imagining we might have to use to cope with bent coins

795
00:55:56,927 --> 00:56:01,023
Using symbol codes only told them into blocks of a block of 10

796
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:07,423
Possible outcomes need to think about 2 to the 10 strings every time you read in another 10 characters

797
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:10,239
That could be very large prefixes

798
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:16,895
Hit we only have to think about and I sing and I conditional probabilities how could it be any smaller

799
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:18,175
This is

800
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:22,015
A fairly small amount of work that you have to do

801
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:30,463
Nope number three another beautiful thing I want you to notice that I had a coating is it compared

802
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:34,047
Packable with any sauce alphabet

803
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:35,327
A nanny

804
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:37,375
Transmitting alphabet

805
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:56,063
As it went through the examples I gave you a ternary alphabet ABC

806
00:56:56,319 --> 00:57:02,463
Can I speak to the been calling A&B and I switch to English with H's at in space you can use any

807
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:08,607
Alphabet and on the encoding side on this right hand side we didn't have to use

808
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:11,679
Binary

809
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:13,215
We could have used

810
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:15,775
Tannery from now on

811
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:19,615
Is it sunny file it's coming out with some zeros ones and twos in it

812
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:22,431
So you can encode into any alphabet

813
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:26,015
That you want as well it's a very beautiful framework for doing compression

814
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:30,111
Arithmetic coding is widely used

815
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:32,927
It's not super well-known

816
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:38,559
But it is in many of the state-of-the-art

817
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:39,839
Compression

818
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:41,119
Standards

819
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:47,519
So I think coding is used in for example JB

820
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:51,359
Which is a binary image compression

821
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:57,503
Standard it's in a language PPM which is very widely used

822
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:59,807
In a text compression

823
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:02,367
And it in

824
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:06,207
Document compression standard Cole deja vu

825
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:12,863
A final thing to note is about arithmetic coding is it completely separate

826
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:19,263
Probabilistic modeling modeling from encoding compression algorithms

827
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:25,663
List things in alphabet

828
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:28,735
The sum rule for converting a 10 to binary

829
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:30,015
Hair

830
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:32,575
The task of probabilistic modeling

831
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:37,951
Is a task for Oracle so you should do artificial intelligence I make really good articles

832
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:44,863
And then when you made your really good article to understand how to predict your language arithmetic coding steps in and tells you had

833
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:45,631
Listen to binary

834
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:52,287
Search for the complete separation of a task of artificial intelligence from spitting out binary strings

835
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:58,687
That feels much more elegant to me than many other compression method which may have some sort of asymptotic

836
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:05,087
Mousy property but they tend to fudge together these two issues they fudged together the probabilistic model

837
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:06,879
Undercoating task

838
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:09,439
Next time

839
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:15,839
We will move on to our next topic which is going to be Communication open noisy channels but I will tell you this

840
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:22,239
Just a few more ideas about automatic coating I'll kick off with one which you will no doubt have no

841
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:27,871
Noticed during this talk which is that you can do other things with us on Earth Magic

842
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:29,407
Coding Concepts

843
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:31,711
So when I just did

844
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:35,295
Remember to go that was I was

845
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:41,695
Demonstrating off Medico de but it's also I looked as if I was writing with the mouse and indeed I was so we can take

846
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:43,231
The

847
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:47,327
Athletic coating Concepts

848
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:53,727
I make a writing tool with my real number generating device called a finger by Ken Jenner

849
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:56,287
The real numbers if I move into my second time

850
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:57,567
And

851
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:59,615
I can write English

852
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:06,015
I cannot write any string at I want in any language tool I will write in English for you pick a sentence let's talk about

853
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:10,111
Efficient generation of samples from ensembles

854
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:12,159
Affogato

855
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:15,231
Hide a gate

856
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:17,791
I got lost

857
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:23,423
Forgot my alphabetical order that's all right

858
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:24,447
Efficient

859
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:26,495
Generation

860
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:38,783
I'm just moving the mouse up and down

861
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:48,767
And simply by moving my finger

862
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:55,935
I can write text

863
01:00:56,447 --> 01:01:01,567
And this is a rising methods that can be driven by any muscle any muscle that can generate real value

864
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:03,615
Signals

865
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:08,991
So I can use my muscles to move something down and out comes English text to the talk

866
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:15,647
This is a record-breaking method for communicating English with very small numbers of muscles

867
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:16,671
With

868
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:23,071
Just a mouse some people can write at 40 was a minute before she was a minute with just one finger it supposed to

869
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:29,471
Possible with a gaze tracker to use No Hands a tool to just look with your eye in this world where you want to go

870
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:31,775
It's a minute

871
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:38,175
Five days alone thanks to the wonders of arithmetic coding that allows you to get the maximum information

872
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:42,527
Contact of the gestures that can be quite painful for disabled people to make

873
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:49,183
So that is cool. Joshua is essentially arithmetic coding turned on its head

874
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:50,719
And

875
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:57,119
So Josh is free software is available from the national website

876
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:58,143
And

877
01:01:58,399 --> 01:02:00,959
I encourage you to Telugu

878
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:06,847
Of questions I will ask you next time is a final question about data compression

879
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:13,247
Here's the question if we've gotten alphabet ABCD with probabilities 1/2 1/4 and 8/8

880
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:16,063
Is this symbol code symbol codes

881
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:22,719
Then what's the probability that a bit plucked at random from the encoded stream will be a woman

882
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:27,327
We'll discuss that question of the first thing we do next time

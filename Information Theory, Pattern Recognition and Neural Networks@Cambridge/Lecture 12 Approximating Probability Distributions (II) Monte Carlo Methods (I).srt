00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,216
Welcome Fletcher 12

2
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:12,288
Today we're going to be talking about

3
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:18,688
What color methods one of several methods you can have in your probability to whenever you call

4
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:22,016
Distribution that you are interested

5
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:29,952
When we were first looking at simple interest problems we just did a complete enumeration of

6
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:33,024
10 million

7
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:39,680
So that's always available as an option but typically complete enumeration just end up taking too long

8
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:43,008
Not more than two or three

9
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:49,920
The plastic method is in the book I'm not planning to talk about it

10
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:56,320
It's complicated distribution it's a bit too big to enumerate and You approximated by a simpler distribution

11
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Mainly I got him

12
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,160
Approximate

13
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:02,976
The distribution of Interest by Gaskin

14
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:11,424
I like Nicole useful ways of dealing with

15
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:13,216
Nasty complicated

16
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:16,032
Distribution by using

17
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,824
Random numbers

18
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,128
So we're going to use random numbers today

19
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:28,320
Simple lecture today and in the next election

20
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:31,904
Advanced methods it really

21
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,440
It's in a good place

22
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:37,280
Call someone that can do things.

23
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:39,328
At least I can do is pasta

24
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:40,864
Bendy

25
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:47,264
Call Alexi will be about variational method switch iMessage

26
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,544
Optical problems

27
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,336
Set yourself

28
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:54,944
Just to remind you this course has a website on the book

29
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,760
Esprit online

30
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:58,784
On the way

31
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:06,464
So here's a little road map of where we're going with want to call him at this very simple Monte Carlo methods

32
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,048
Slightly more complicated

33
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:13,376
And then we'll get home today I really fancy method

34
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,216
Electra plan is already discussed clustering

35
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:22,848
In this lecture on simple Monte Carlo what country get up to

36
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,944
Whisper by the red line go get up to

37
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:31,040
Truckers message on Gibson playing leaving the second half

38
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,064
The following

39
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,088
Lecture

40
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,696
I want to remind you what we did

41
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:40,512
In the last lecture which was a bad clustering

42
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,584
This gave us an example of

43
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,424
Distribution that we were interested in and it would

44
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,960
It would like this

45
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:58,432
Probability distribution we were interested in

46
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:01,248
Call

47
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,856
A whole load of unknown me you on YouTube

48
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:11,232
A whole load of unknown standard deviation signal Wong

49
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,536
Citgo 2

50
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:20,960
How late is unknown weight High Wang Pi 2 to Taipei

51
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:25,824
A whole load of unknown assignments all

52
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:30,944
Foster's C1 C2

53
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,504
C3 up to cm

54
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,528
You can think of

55
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:40,928
C walk

56
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,488
Walk to 3

57
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,512
Decay

58
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:54,240
I still have complete the list of things you don't know or how I guess that's the list of all the things you don't know

59
00:03:55,008 --> 00:04:01,152
Given the data which was at a point X1 X2

60
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,456
Talk to text app

61
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:11,904
The problem is he were interested in is the posterior probability distribution

62
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,744
Call

63
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:23,167
All of these things given the data

64
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:29,311
Given the assumption

65
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,223
Today tithi

66
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,247
Come from

67
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:41,855
Distribution with these means and standard deviations on white circle

68
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:45,439
Given that the X's are assumed to come from a mixture

69
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,719
Call cassia

70
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:50,047
That was the model we receiving in the last election

71
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,911
And we discussed briefly the idea that you could

72
00:04:55,167 --> 00:05:00,287
Alternative models instead of a mixture of gaseous a mixture of some other sort of distributions

73
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:06,687
I'm still you would have an indifference problem why you are not interested in exploring the unknown factor locations

74
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,967
Sizes and shapes

75
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,527
I need the unknown assignments

76
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,295
Given

77
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,319
Bodega

78
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:15,135
As a real world example of this

79
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:21,791
You could imagine that you have a thousand manuscripts that have been transcribed by scribes back in the air when

80
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,095
When everything was done with handwriting

81
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:29,215
And you take those thighs money script situations official documents

82
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:37,407
You want to install a couple of these characters

83
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:43,807
Which characters were written by which Stripes because if you can infer that interesting things about

84
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,599
Sociology of the community

85
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,903
Scribes in the ancient world

86
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:54,047
And they're all trying to make a hundred writing looks very similar to each other but nevertheless you can actually most of them

87
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:58,143
This guy's I use Robin the other guys

88
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:01,471
Example of

89
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:04,799
Why you might want to do this with handwriting recognition

90
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:09,407
Stop what does that supposed to registration look like

91
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,431
Well

92
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:13,503
If we call all of these promises

93
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,527
Pizza

94
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:21,183
Then the probability with dealing with

95
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:26,303
Is a pizza given over later

96
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:31,167
And that's why Bayes Theorem is reversible

97
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,191
Texas

98
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:40,383
I'm going to change my mind about

99
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,783
Viola paramitas it say where the men's cut

100
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,647
Assignments be another thing.

101
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:57,279
Where are the closest

102
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:03,423
Well how well did those hypotheses predicting

103
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,239
How credible

104
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:15,199
Emagine Novi

105
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,735
Dividing by

106
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:32,351
Often it's a good idea to deal with the long sauce things like

107
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:37,471
Great big brothers from 1 to end

108
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,519
LakePoint

109
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,735
Things like log overseas

110
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:53,087
Best

111
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,767
Lunch

112
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,911
Okay

113
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:08,959
No

114
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:13,311
Ashley

115
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,335
Book about

116
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,247
Walk the log

117
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:24,063
Episcopal

118
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,903
Pizza and see what you

119
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:34,303
Charles look like that and once you tell

120
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:40,447
Cheap eye glass.

121
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:48,127
These terms hat will be will have your pride distribution is

122
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:01,695
List me true that I have my PSP Vita

123
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,535
Some of those is this walking

124
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,327
The Lord's eyes

125
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,863
Being

126
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:13,727
Coming from hair

127
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,775
Point

128
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,079
Armstrong

00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,127
Assignats 2

130
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,407
Feisty

131
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,967
Micellaire

132
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:24,735
Is

133
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:33,439
Why am I writing Miss Alaska remind you of what we did last time and remember size that

134
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:39,839
We are interested in is something we can write down

135
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,935
And we can ride on almost the whole law

136
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:48,287
Except usually this normalizing cousin Pat is complete pain in bum

137
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:53,919
Because you actually write them that we would need to do an integral

138
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,527
Sigma

139
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:05,951
Play Popeye the gravy summation of April fees as well

140
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,511
You got this

141
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:11,583
But it is just a single constant

142
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,863
Just one number

143
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,167
Stop

144
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:19,519
What we notice about this distribution that we are interested in

145
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:23,871
We noticed we can compute it except normalizing consul

146
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:29,759
Song not going to define the rules of the game apply

147
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:34,111
When was stealing

148
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,671
Rules of the game

149
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:44,863
Probability distribution that were in president

150
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,679
And it's going to be cold pay

151
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:50,751
And it's going to eat Pista

152
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,287
/ zet

153
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,895
The rules of the game are

154
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,175
That we

155
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,735
Evaluate

156
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,807
Please stop

157
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,415
And secondly

158
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,535
We don't know that

159
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:20,959
Call Empress

160
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:24,031
Tell us that we would be delighted to

161
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:26,079
No it be call

162
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:32,479
Remember what was that so this is what we needed to do if you want chicken pad.

163
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:37,855
Did you like that with the one that says the 7 plus you need to know this moment

164
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,743
So

165
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,535
Return about right piece.

166
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,839
We don't know that we love to know it but will

167
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:52,447
Be playing if we don't end up

168
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:58,079
Goal of the month

169
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:06,015
In general I'm not going to generalize it's a good thing

170
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:11,135
This thing here in this case the unknown parameter assignments

171
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:17,279
I'm going to get that a name is going to be cold packs from now

172
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,583
This is the thing

173
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,143
The unknown

174
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,983
Variables

175
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:32,639
I'm going to call X why is the name

176
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:35,711
Texas the names of the unknown mean to send deviation

177
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,991
Assignment

178
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,015
Major points

179
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,807
Two Costas

180
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,111
Stop

181
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,671
What else to say about the rules of the game

182
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,463
What we actually want to know

183
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:49,535
Regardless probability distribution we are interested in

184
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,607
We can evaluate it that any particular

185
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:56,191
Any particular

186
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:59,775
Argument so you can pick an axe I'll be trying to go that

187
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,311
Lugging that value

188
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,079
Call

189
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:05,919
I'm workout

00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,575
Well

191
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:21,791
What we want to do is solve these two problems

192
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:31,519
So just to recap notation we could have read distribution and I always write the nasty distribution in red

193
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,311
Red

194
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:39,199
Have you written without loss of the minus key of x / 10

195
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:43,039
I was just take you to log off Pizza

196
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:48,415
So the assumption is that we can if I were a pizza or we can evaluate

197
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,695
DMX

198
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:53,023
Child allergy attack smiley

199
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:59,167
And to ideally

200
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:03,519
We would like to draw samples from this

201
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,799
Dusty distribution

202
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,079
What does that mean

203
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:12,479
That means I want to take this posterior distribution and come up with some plausible representative

204
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,247
Obit

205
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:19,647
I want to know what the means

206
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,863
That's just one

207
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:35,519
Right now when I say I'm drunk samples please don't get confused growing point in this

208
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,079
It's

209
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:41,919
Taking a risk taxes now the name for

210
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:48,063
The date was given its fixed and I was wondering around

211
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,599
Pasta station

212
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,927
Coming up in sample from the posterior distribution

213
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,023
From 2 is

214
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,631
We would like to estimate the expectation of sanctions under this distribution

215
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:04,447
What do I mean will it give you an example

216
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,287
Let's imagine that were very interested in knowing

217
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,055
Weather

218
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:11,103
The characters

219
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:17,503
Well written by the same scribe Illinois results

220
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,319
Right

221
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,623
So what would that mean you want to know

222
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,975
That means you want to know

223
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,791
2 datapoint

224
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,095
The N1

225
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,911
And end points

226
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:38,751
Lavezzi

227
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,519
Or not

228
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:45,919
We don't know but give him the date that we can infer

229
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:50,015
So what we want to do is take the posterior probability

230
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:55,647
Call timer thing

231
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:59,487
We want to know that average

232
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,327
Averaging over Theatre

233
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,863
Coming over

234
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:10,239
Barry Simon we want to know

235
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:16,127
High probability that this proposition is true

236
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:20,223
Walmart Pharmacy

237
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:26,879
We want to know the average under the function which is wrong when the two

238
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:30,207
Is there another one if we can compute this

239
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,999
Expectation hat

240
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,047
Tell me about the answer to the question

241
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:44,031
So what am I saying I'm saying that the question how probable is it that these two seas are the same

242
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,591
Can be written as an expectation

243
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:52,479
Another thing you might want to know if you're doing clustering

244
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,015
Is

245
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,063
You might want to know

246
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,879
How probable is it

247
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,415
One of the means

248
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:04,511
Is somewhere in this is is in this box

249
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:12,703
And again you can introduce function that is wrong when the meat is in the average

250
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,543
Under the table

251
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,407
Questions that you have

252
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:25,247
And usually be expressed as expectations

253
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,039
Questions office wall

254
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,855
What should I believe about this variable

255
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,135
Given the data

256
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:39,583
Generalizing that General puzzle minimum distribution and they give you some functions

257
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,375
Average value state

258
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:50,847
And now we can forget about clustering

259
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:57,503
Just in case you don't care about my strength I'm going to give you one more problem that can be expressed in this way

260
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,343
Let's train

261
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,903
I'll give you another problem physics

262
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:08,511
Problem of understanding

263
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:12,351
Is nanotechnologies really cool

264
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,911
So let's say you come now I'm like this

265
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,447
And you got

266
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,543
A theory of what the energy of being anemic

267
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:26,943
The energy depends on the state of all the things in your nana Market

268
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:35,647
So that's cool X the state of Atlanta Market

269
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,951
And let's say the time is not a magnet

270
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:44,607
Made out of 10 by 10 by 10 Spencer's only a thousand

271
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,143
Honey

272
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:53,311
Oh maybe it's a planar object made us Russia x 32 spin

273
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,103
House in Spanish

274
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,407
And we gonna sell

275
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:05,855
An energy function which is the energy of those things if they're in

276
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,207
What might that look like

277
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:13,791
Well maybe it's a nice simple not a magnet

278
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,071
You energy

279
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:17,631

282
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,823
Each of these

286
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:41,439
I may be DMX

287
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:44,767
Given the couplings J between spins on the

288
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,559
Convert temperature Ibiza

289
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:50,143
Is 18 - 3

290
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:57,567
/ depends on pizza

291
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:02,175
And the coupling where the couplings

292
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:08,831
Box determine the couplings jj72 energy in the fall

293
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,559
Find and Prime

294
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:24,191
Coupling J and and Prime text and

295
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:30,079
So that's a fairly standard expression for

296
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:33,151
The energy of a magnet with

297
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,711
Subnautica

298
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:39,807
And what sort of things does someone wants to know about that Nana magnet

299
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:44,927
Well they might want to know what's the average Energy Office thing

300
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:51,327
Under the distribution T distribution T and read vs read

301
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:56,703
He is radon's nasty

302
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,495
Cufflinks

303
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,311
Lookout Valley high standards

304
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:10,271
But it does not say because I actually if I tell you I got his a couple of Matrix what is the average energy

305
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:14,623
You'll struggle to answer you could try to do if I complete enumeration

306
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:21,280
If you wanted to do my completion you might have to do some over all values of x

307
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:24,352
Red

308
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,656
And

309
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,448
That would be the opportunity

310
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:34,848
But to do that you would have to some over to Sitar and state switches to supply 1000

311
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,128
State

312
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,944
PewDiePie 1000

313
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,992
Is

314
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,832
Let's put it this way

315
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:49,184
Imagine that you had access to all the electrons in the universe

316
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:52,000
10 to the 80

317
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:58,400
Electrons in the Universe imagine that you might have to send every one of those electrons into a powerful computer

318
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:02,240
I'd like to do operations for you

319
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:05,824
I know you have the entire age of the universe to do it then

320
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,872
The age of the universe

321
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:14,016
Is that the truth of time 98 seconds

322
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,184
2 to the 266 Electronics

323
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:28,352
You have every single life in the universe age of the universe

324
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:35,008
Is operations you must like those two by each other and see how many operations you can do

325
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:41,408
Pick some up

326
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:47,040
Allstate 10 by 10

327
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:56,512
So you can do this even though the energy is a very simple thing

328
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:08,288
So that one thing you might want to know another thing you might want to know if I can get his hands in it

329
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:14,688
Its energy so you might want to have a variance of the energy or currently average energy

330
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:19,808
If you know both of these fluctuations are an interesting thing to know that

331
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,344
So you might want to know that

332
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:26,976
You might want to know what the mean magnetisation

333
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,280
The magnet

334
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:35,936
What's a very intimate magnetisation so you can find the magnetisation in some way

335
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:38,496
Function you invented

336
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:41,824
Play I am interested in knowing is mean or is variance

337
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:48,480
You might want to know the entry of your nana magnet than that is the average of log

338
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,016
1 / p

339
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:54,112
You might also want to know that

340
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,904
Bruno Mars in concert

341
00:23:56,416 --> 00:24:02,048
Because that is very exciting you don't have to

342
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:10,752
The mothers that is essentially the free energy

343
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:14,080
We Energies

344
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,616
Property

345
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,200
Things like these as well

346
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:21,248
Can Ole be expressed

347
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:27,904
In times of exit expectations

348
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:32,000
Expectation

349
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:38,400
Find the ethical the log deadlifting in it as well that is roughly the average of the energy

350
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,728
So

351
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,800
That's the second example

352
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:45,568
Call

353
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:49,152
Problems that we have

354
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:53,248
Probability distribution

355
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:57,344
The energy can be evaluated

356
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,928
Easy thing to do but the entire distribution

357
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:04,768
A difficult think I'll give it to you and I

358
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:11,424
What's a typical States samples show me 10 random samples

359
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,264
And just look at it

360
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,312
And random samples from the sea

361
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:25,248
Final thing to note is we want to solve problem

362
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,784
Both of Interest

363
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:33,440
The salt problem to which is to know the expected values opening

364
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:40,352
If you have sole can you use that as a way of solving problem to

365
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,656
If you walked so problem to

366
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,472
Can be sold

367
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,408
Because

368
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,688
Someone

369
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,480
Gives you

370
00:25:57,248 --> 00:26:03,392
Some point I'm going to go get your label within a random sample if they give you a set of capital

371
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,208
XR

372
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,120
Which do really come from Moonachie distribution paid because you have souls program War

373
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:14,912
Then

374
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,704
You can

375
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:17,984
Estimate

376
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:24,384
Expectations of function for example if someone says what is the average value of FX

377
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,920
On the p

378
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,016
Expected value

379
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:35,392
Time estimate that by saying

380
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:37,952
Well I'm going to ride down hat pass

381
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,744
I'm just got.

382
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,072
Through all the points that you just given me in this random set

383
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:46,144
I got to see what the mean of that is

384
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,168
Honda

385
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:50,240
Empirical distribution

386
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,152
And that means any functions app

387
00:26:57,408 --> 00:27:02,016
I can just take you the are random places you give me and I can estimate

388
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,552
Expectations

389
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:09,184
Using those are points in the bigger RS

390
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:11,744
The better those estimates will be

391
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,096
Play Someday We'll be to the true value of the expectation

392
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,984
So that means

393
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:28,384
It's a great trip.

394
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:36,576
Message will solar Pokemon

395
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,744
Things went by there on the screen

396
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:50,656
We are not trying to find the most probable State the goal of these masconomet is not to say

397
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:55,520
What is the state that minimizes dentist

398
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,312
We don't want to do that

399
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:00,384
You might want to do that if you how to do motivation

400
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,736
You don't want to know what is beam

401
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:11,136
Most rural States

402
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:19,072
And for the assignments of points to clusters and where the means go we don't want to know

403
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:22,656
Assignment

404
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:24,192
Like remember last time

405
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:33,408
Make some cow seems like this the most probable way of assigning points to me

406
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:39,040
It's disabled all of these are in

407
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:45,440
Flights to NOLA

408
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:49,792
It's not

409
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:53,120
Call Sababa allocations where these guy tails

410
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:54,912
You're being

411
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:02,080
So not trying to find the most probable state

412
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:05,152
Your is the purpose of problem wall

413
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,176
To visit

414
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:11,808
Allstate's we're not going to try and exhaustively new Rachel States and in some random way

415
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:15,136
Because that would take the lifetime beautimous

416
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:22,560
When visiting all states not even visiting oil typical State because

417
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:25,632
Still have two to the very last number

418
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,448
States

419
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:33,312
I'm trying to be clear what we want to do in the morning

420
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:39,200
I see what we're trying to do it would be brilliant if we could just roll say it doesn't point

421
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:48,416
Call my baby

422
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,184
Call Pops

423
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:55,840
Any size are probably doesn't matter if it's very very hard

424
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:58,144
Zillow you need in order to estimate

425
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,472
Expectations of functions

Alpine Ski

427
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,544
What's

428
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,128
So let me know

429
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:10,432
Show you some elements

430
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:26,048
Is Adventure introducing green things in green things

431
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,080
Navigate to work

432
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:43,968
Thumb problem I can show on the screen which means the main going to be one-dimensional problem

433
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,832
So care is

434
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:49,856
In red

435
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:56,768
A probability density curve apps

436
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,608
I'm not in bed

437
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:04,960
Which is what you would get if you're stung the girl hundreds of pets

438
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:10,080
Summer

439
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:12,128
So we don't know who's that

440
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,688
All we have is the ability to

441
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,224
Take a Valium

442
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,272
And then the computer will speak out

443
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,552
Value

444
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:25,952
Pictures of the misleading the real world of a month colorful

445
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:34,400
What is Pista

446
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:41,056
Then you go somewhere else

447
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:53,856
You have the ability to evaluate by which is a function of interest and have 5 Active

448
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,136
A linear function

449
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:57,440
Call Pat

450
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:03,072
It could be could be

451
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:06,912
I'm over going to do is

452
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:13,568
Progressed through the secrets of steadily Monte Carlo

453
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:19,968
Delta blinds Supply in Culpeper the blanco person is not going to be around by some random numbers in Subway

454
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:24,064
And they're going to take the blindfold off and CP.

455
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,856
I'm going to get you grounded

456
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:33,024
ICP start again and somehow the goal is that these extra random numbers that we used

457
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,048
Take them around

458
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:37,120
Actually help them answer problems longhunter

459
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:46,336
Getting a blind man to run the numbers help them appreciate the big picture

460
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:50,432
That is the beauty of Monte Carlo

461
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,552
What I just showed you with a p that was just finding a real valued

462
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,832
SpaceX

463
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:59,904
We could

464
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,744
Licensing place

465
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,608
Prepaid with 2000

466
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,632
Volume

467
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:16,544
And you can

468
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:22,944
And then you can go somewhere else

469
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,808
Values of Pista

470
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:33,696
This is a simplified depiction of

471
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:35,488
Okay

472
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:37,792
I'm going to stop by

473
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:38,816
Introducing

474
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,632
A proposal distribution

475
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:49,056
Oris sampler density

476
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:52,896
He's going to be the uniform distribution

477
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:56,736
So what we going to do is going to say

478
00:33:56,992 --> 00:34:00,320
Let's assume that we can draw points uniformly

479
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:02,112
Rolex

480
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,464
I'm going to use that ability to then discuss

481
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,584
Solving problem to

482
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:16,704
But maybe we can find the expected value of pi

483
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:21,312
So what I'm telling here is our role in yellow

484
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:26,944
How is my cousin random points in yellow

485
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,272
And then what we can do points

486
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:34,624
We can write down an estimate

487
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,648
All

488
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,184
Function

489
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,592
Is a

490
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:58,176
Nasty distribution rash

491
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:03,040
Simply distribution HQ that we cannot see drool points

492
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:07,648
Sample identity has the

493
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,464
Wrong

494
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:17,120
EQ Michaelis

495
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,496
When we drop points from Q something you could imagine doing

496
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:26,848
Is finding the average of all of these functions

497
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:31,200
So as we drool

498
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:34,528
Random point buy at Lowe's

499
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:43,232
If we just invested average / then what were you doing

500
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:46,048
Is finding the average of spy

501
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,120
But it should be the wrong thing

502
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:56,032
I understand we would get it fix it up

503
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,056
8 point

504
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,360
In the ratio of

505
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:12,928
Sophia Valley Way. East Point

506
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:14,464
Askew

507
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:23,424
Do there is well into the uniform distribution wolfychu's will just be

508
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:26,752
Send

509
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:33,408
Replacing points in places where Q is too small of a Down Wiki

510
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:38,272
And I said to you but I think he started thinking about it right

511
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:41,856
And then we need a different nobody customs

512
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:46,464
And something you can pass yourself off as such

513
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:53,120
I know magic will do the job is the sum of all of these plates

514
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:55,936
Puppy Starbucks

515
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,264
CEO of Exxon

516
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:05,152
So what I'm doing here is

517
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,456
In general called

518
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:10,272
Importance sampling

519
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:15,648
So we chondrule points from t

520
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:19,232
If we could then we would have a way of solving problems

521
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:25,632
Are we doing says we draw from a different distribution the weekend Reliant from and then we correctly relatable

522
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:28,704
Correct sport using the wrong

523
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:33,568
And that gives us an estimator all

524
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:39,968
Is the truth

525
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:42,784
Shopify

526
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,088
Is the true average value

527
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,416
Just think about this

528
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,696
Excuse

529
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:53,792
Say what is the expected value of

530
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:58,400
Hee Haw facts

531
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:01,472
I would sum function Spotify

532
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,056
Next expected value office

533
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:08,384
When you drool points from 2

534
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:17,344
Answering the question that work the expected value

535
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,440
One of these terms hat

536
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:25,024
Expected value of P star that saw

537
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,864
Play vacuum

538
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:32,192
X fi Alexa

539
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:38,592
That expected value is the integral off that thing under Q

540
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:42,944
What is integral

541
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,224
Please stop

542
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:51,136
Pyrex which is apartment

543
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:54,720
So that's a justification for why this we waiting at the right

544
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:01,120
What we have on the screen here

545
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,168
Is

546
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,448
The estimate

547
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,728
Gratifying

548
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:12,640
Apple pie hat as the number of samples increases the top graph is showing

549
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:15,200
Increase from wall up to 50

550
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:17,248
What happened to the estimate

551
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,624
Uniform distribution that you can use this formula

552
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:27,744
For any distribution so for example we can make the green distribution the symbol distribution

553
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,280
I got you

554
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:36,192
And is a green gas in like a week but I got like an drawer joints

555
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,984
Call Daniela

556
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:42,080
Define

557
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:47,456
As a function of the number of samples

558
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:50,784
And you can do this with any width of gas in July

559
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,344
So you could take a very narrow Gaskin

560
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,904
Jessie

561
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,928
F i

562
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:03,584
Something you might realize is that if it was meant to be on the registration

563
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:09,216
Most of the registration is hat a none of the elephants actually visited that

564
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:13,824
This is actually completely wrong

565
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:17,664
Novus way of realizing that because

566
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:21,504
Pushing the blind man Iran takes off his blindfold

567
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,576
How you look city season 5

568
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:27,904
We telling this magic ways to be wasting by

569
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:33,280
I promised him the eventually if he does is provide a long time we give him enough points are

570
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:36,608
Then he'll eventually get the right answer

571
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:42,496
Well that's a very dangerous thing to do, because obviously you could

572
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:47,104
Just keep visiting places in you might never visit the places where

573
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,896
The red caboose

574
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:54,528
Remember to go I said it would be fine if it doesn't

575
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,064
El Paso

576
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,624
That was for solving problems

577
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:05,024
Using

578
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,560
Wrong distribution

579
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:07,584
I'm sorry

580
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:14,496
The number of points required for this could be absolutely no it just depends how close

581
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:16,800
Green distribution is the registration

582
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:19,616
And it is very narrow or if it's in the wrong place

583
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:22,432
It will take forever

584
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:30,112
Is Metro distribution and now you draw 51

585
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,928
One of the themes of

586
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:35,744
Lecture on Simple Man, it will be

587
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,144
That the month, may have some sort of guarantee that it will work well as our gets big

588
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:49,312
But you have no way of knowing I do run the algorithm whether it is actually giving you the right answer yet or not

589
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:56,223
Is a graph showing for those four distribution so we just played with in Greece fix the red

590
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:56,991
Mission

591
00:41:57,247 --> 00:42:03,391
We went through a green distribution uniform than one Gaston & Gaston

592
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:07,487
This shows the estimate that you got most full mattress

593
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:10,303
As the number of flights increased from Guam

594
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:13,119
50 draws from the greatest

595
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:18,495
I need to see the old bumbleride

596
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:24,639
Volume

597
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,431
From the others

598
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:32,575
So what would you say if you run this experiment

599
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:37,695
Call Andrew just don't know any of these you don't know

600
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:42,815
The value that begin to look talk and completely change the let's run it for bit longer

601
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,119
R2000 decorations

602
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:46,399
This is what happens

603
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:49,215
So all of them wander around 11

604
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:52,287
Three-button moms are settling down on something

605
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:58,687
Because

606
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:05,087
It managed to hit a place where.

607
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:11,487
Naruto

608
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:15,071
Please change

609
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:23,263
This formula may have Samsung Direction behind it but it doesn't come with a health warning the health warning should say

610
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:27,871
Please wait could sometimes be almost infinitely large

611
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:35,295
When you use this formula for only re

612
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:38,111
Because you haven't included

613
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:45,023
Point

614
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:52,703
How much is 11 pesos

615
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:54,239
Neverside Maybe

616
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:05,247
Yes sir the comment is if you see some shoes way it's an indication that you could have died distribution

617
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:11,903
So does that help you you could have got you something I keep an eye on the way to see if any big weights

618
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:16,255
Just rewind a moment when we don't you think

619
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:25,215
That's just the fact that it wasn't any big weight doesn't mean but everything's fine

620
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:26,495
Business

621
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:32,895
Must Implement, is always a nervousness that no matter how many

622
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:39,295
Messages looking like it's okay it could be that you all just something from complete

623
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,855
Eventually applicable come along

624
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:48,255
Finally that is in the typical set

625
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:55,935
You can keep an eye on the variance of the weight lover of a movement of the way and that may help you

626
00:44:56,191 --> 00:45:02,335
But you can't get any guarantee you that you're in.

627
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:07,711
Next

628
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:09,247
Let's talk trash

629
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:11,039
Rejection sampling

630
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:14,623
The rejection sampling uses a

631
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,671
Sampler

632
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:20,511
Which is simple enough that we can draw samples from it

633
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:22,559
So we have the same

634
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:24,607
Master distribution t

635
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:31,519
The assumption is

636
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:35,615
Can we have a simple distribution cute

637
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:39,711
So which we have a mathematical proof a guarantee

638
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:41,759
That we really know

639
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:43,295
That

640
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:49,439
3 * Q

641
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:53,535
Is everywhere

642
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:59,167
Biga Pizza

643
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:04,543
So the assumption is that somehow you have been able to prove that

644
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:06,591
Is Grayson Dolan or equal to

645
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:10,943
East Arvak's everywhere

646
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,063
And assuming that is true

647
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:20,415
Send

648
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:22,463
We draw points from cute

649
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:26,815
Anytime you draw a point

650
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,863
We also drawer

651
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:30,911
A vesicle coordinates

652
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:36,543
So the algorithm is like this

653
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:42,431
Rolex from

654
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:48,575
Jewelry uniform variable

655
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:51,903
From uniform distribution

656
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,439
It goes from 0

657
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:55,999
Times to All Pets

658
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:01,375
So that means having drawn the next from the screen distribution

659
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:04,191
Say yeah

660
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:07,263
Revente give me a uniform

661
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:11,103
That could come

662
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:21,599
3 fu is less than pizza

663
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:25,695
Switch the line Pokemon

664
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:27,231
Then

665
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,583
Accept

666
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:33,887
Text

667
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:37,983
Except mean that we spit this out and we put it

668
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:40,543
In the bucket

669
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:44,639
Contains all about EX

670
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:49,247
Otherwise

671
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:51,807
Rejected

672
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:53,855
Amsterdam rejection sampling

673
00:47:54,879 --> 00:48:01,023
Let me just throw it away if you don't put it in the bucket

674
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:03,071
Serum

675
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:07,935
Points to get put in the bucket 6 drawer from

676
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:11,519
Victoria Lee

677
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:15,359
So what I'm done

678
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:17,151
Tara Strong

679
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:19,455
50 samples

680
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:22,015
From the green distribution

681
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:24,831
Everyone

682
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:29,439
Uniformly distributed between the horizontal axis

683
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:30,463
The green light

684
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:34,559
That means that all of those points needed in blue or yellow

685
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:37,631
Area

686
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:39,167
Under the green cup

687
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:42,751
That's what this construction give you that warm

688
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:46,591
That gives you a point he's going to text you

689
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:48,639
Our uniform under the green cup

690
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:54,527
Then if you use scissors and you cut out all the ones that are colored blue under the red cup

691
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:59,135
Those points must be uniformly distributed in the area

692
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:03,999
Throw away all the other one, exactly

693
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:05,535
Brompton registration

694
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:14,495
And it's absolutely crucial that it must be true

695
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,519
It's bigger than

696
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:17,567
Play Store

697
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:18,847
Because

698
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:21,663
It's not true as shown by

699
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:26,015
This example of point to pretend that you're doing rejection sampling

700
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:32,415
You will reject the other points of the distribution you are actually drawing Point call its substrate

701
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:35,999
Change distribution

702
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:37,023
Cream of chicken

703
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:42,655
So it's crucial that you must be stopped

704
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:47,007
Alopecia reason complicated distribution this understand

705
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:49,055
It may be a very difficult

706
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:52,895
True that you have colic you for which this is true

707
00:49:54,687 --> 00:50:00,831
It's not just that you have to know that it's true for some say you have to say that it just repurposed

708
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:04,415
Need that seat

709
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:05,951
X c

710
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:08,255
Beautiful number

711
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:10,559
Okay

712
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:19,263
Okay so the comment is it's very easy to check

713
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:25,919
Whether SECU is bigger than the places where you actually Drew

714
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:27,455
I'm at signature

715
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,735
So you could

716
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:30,783
Check

717
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:32,831
Los angele

718
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:36,927
Broad point you but also see if you had a good warm

719
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:38,719
Glenwood

720
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:42,815
Sorry if you would equal

721
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:44,351
60 * 2

722
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:47,679
Would it still be left in peace.

723
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:56,639
So yes you can check if you really want us there on this has

724
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:59,199
If you run this algorithm School long enough

725
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:00,991
You'll get the right answer

726
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:03,551
I'm so just checking in

727
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:09,439
Okay interrogan is the estimate of the expected value

728
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:13,023
The message restore are we still using

729
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:15,583
Importance sampling

730
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:20,959
And then in green answer for rejection

731
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:22,495
Throwing from the stretch

732
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:23,519
Distribution

733
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:24,543
You can see it

734
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:28,383
It's settling down as well in the same way as the other three

735
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:33,503
Okay are there any questions about

736
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:35,807
Sampling or

737
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:38,111
Rejection sampling

738
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:48,863
How to draw simple cute cute the assumption is that shoe is a distribution that we can draw

739
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:49,631
So

740
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:56,031
In a real space in my P I got you

741
00:51:56,799 --> 00:52:02,943
In a case of the spins the sort of thing you could use for Q might be

742
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:07,551
The distribution where the end spins in the magnet

743
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:13,951
Just flips a biased coin of some sort to decide whether

744
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:17,023
Then that's a very easy distribution to draw

745
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:19,327
You might use

746
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:24,191
Navigate distribution that doesn't have strong correlations in it

747
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:28,031
It does have correlations in it among variables

748
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:32,895
That's simple enough that you can still

749
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:41,087
Rejection sampling is wonderful and usually you can't do it

750
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:45,951
They'll be two reasons why you can't do it either you can't think of it

751
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:51,071
Such that SECU account

752
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:54,655
Call if you can come up with such a

753
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:58,751
Have a proof of this property

754
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:05,407
It may be so much higher than the TV that you end up rejecting every single point running

755
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:07,455
Navigate

756
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:13,599
Maya

757
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:14,623
Come the Reckoning

758
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:21,791
Okay so that's the sad truth about rejection something unless you're very lucky or very clever

759
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:27,167
You would make a test

760
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:32,543
In one-dimensional, like the ones we had on the screen just now

761
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:36,383
Japan realistic approach

762
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:39,711
The message we're about to discuss

763
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:43,807
Metropolis

764
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:49,183
Is you can't have two projections of the component in those

765
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:53,279
So let's move on now I'm talk about the Metropolis message

766
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,863
Send a message we looked at so far

767
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:59,935
How much kilometers

768
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:04,031
The blindfold man

769
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:10,943
Was told to go to a random place

770
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:12,991
Moving around

771
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:14,015
In a way

772
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:15,807
Where every move

773
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:17,087
Is independence

774
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:21,951
Avenue locations

775
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:26,815
The Metropolis method

776
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:29,375
It's going to be an example of a Markov

777
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:30,143
Chain

778
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:34,751
Which means that instead of asking

779
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:36,543
The blind old man

780
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:38,335
You go to a new location

781
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:41,407
Independence Square

782
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:47,039
There is now going to be a dependent on where he is at the moment so wherever he is now

783
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:49,343
We're going to move him to a new location

784
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:51,391
The depends on his current location

785
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:58,815
Why you should not help is not at all clear that is why do we want that to be a dependents

786
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:04,191
That's what we're going to do

787
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:07,263
Try

788
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:11,359
Well this is the next location

789
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:16,479
And this is the current location

790
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:20,575
I need something is going to be that we can draw from here

791
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:26,207
Becky was going to be something simple like a gasoline distribution or flipping Bank on

792
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:28,767
Resume that we can evaluate

793
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:33,375
We have an Icee distribution

794
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:37,983
Red

795
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:43,103
Shoes

796
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:45,407
It look like

797
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:51,295
This is the current location

798
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:58,975
Listen to current location

799
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:05,119
Then maybe you might look like

800
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:10,239
That's the sort of concept rehab Maybe

801
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:15,359
Choose just a distribution that send it on the current location and put those things a little bit

802
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:17,919
It can be any distribution you lie

803
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:24,575
As long as you can draw from it and you can evaluate it so you can think of that you as being completely General

804
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:25,599
Distribution

805
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:29,439
That you can draw from this is the sort of thing that people use

806
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:31,743
Is a small nudge to decide

807
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:36,607
Perhaps a big nuts could you say broadcasting if you want

808
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:39,935
Any distribution that you can draw from

809
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:43,007
So it's okay

810
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:46,591
But used to be

811
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:49,151
Simple or complicated

812
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:52,991
And something to imply to

813
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:54,271
Is

814
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:56,575
It's okay but you

815
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:58,111
2

816
00:56:58,367 --> 00:56:59,647
Knox

817
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:00,927
Look like me

818
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:06,047
Importance sampling

819
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:12,191
Rejection sampling really well it's cute looks just like me because then you're done

820
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:17,823
If you can make it to that looks like pee and you can draw from it

821
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:21,151
Then that means you can solve the equation problem.

822
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:28,063
In the Metropolis it's okay.

823
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,599
It could be

824
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:34,207
Completely different so it would be okay

825
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:35,743
Abiquiu

826
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:42,399
Like this and it looks like

827
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:45,983
And that's not going to be a problem

828
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:53,407
Typical property that she was actually going to have

829
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:58,783
Is going to be the typically shoe just makes a small change in the energy of the sea

830
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:01,343
It is going to work

831
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:06,719
Then

832
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:08,255
Usually

833
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:12,863
Makes

834
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:15,167
Just a small change

835
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:17,215
The energy

836
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:21,823
How does you being logged.

837
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:26,175
Smol meaning

838
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:29,503
Okay

839
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:35,391
Distribution were granted replying from depends on the previous state

840
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:38,975
So how does the algorithm work

841
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,559
It's kind of like

842
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:49,983
Thyme tea

843
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:53,567
We Alright location XP

844
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:58,431
Can we do the following

845
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:01,503
Generate

846
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:03,807
A new point

847
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:10,207
From effects

848
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:17,119
Compute something

849
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:24,031
Tells us whether we want to go there or not which is the acceptance ratio

850
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:29,919
And a looks a lot like the

851
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:35,039
Things we had an important something about just going to have a Pista

852
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:36,575
Display

853
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:38,879
It's going to be divided by

854
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:40,671
Acute

855
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:43,231
This place

856
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:50,399
That looks just like a waste of Haddon

857
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:56,287
But we also need to take account of what weight is in the place

858
00:59:56,799 --> 01:00:00,127
What would come from still take a piece out of XT

859
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:04,991
I will take the corresponding chewy says if we will

860
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:07,295
Annex and we drew from

861
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:10,111
This place hexes

862
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:11,391
Shoe distribution

863
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:15,743
How likely is it that we come back to NXT where we are at the moment

864
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:17,279
So we work out

865
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:19,071
Ball sack

866
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:23,423
How big to of XT is assuming that you stop

867
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:28,031
Yeah

868
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:31,871
The question is

869
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:34,943
Do we need to know the normalizing constant

870
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:40,063
And the answer is well no not necessarily both of these cute I have

871
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:43,135
The same normal I can come see each other

872
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:45,951
Then you don't need to know

873
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:48,255
On the other hand it

874
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:50,559
Call Chu house the pool

875
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:53,119
You saw that

876
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:56,191
And that's that depends on this argument hat

877
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:56,959
Then

878
01:00:57,983 --> 01:01:00,031
You do need to know this hats

879
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:01,823
In general

880
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:05,407
That's the nature of that it will in general have an XT dependents

881
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:07,199
But it does

882
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:07,967
Zedd

883
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:12,831
At least you know I need to know this that religion some

884
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:13,855
All right

885
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:18,719
This is what we do

886
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:26,399
If we ignore the acceptance ratio then all we would be doing is something to run the world

887
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:32,031
It wouldn't be looking at the atoll

888
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:40,735
Never looking pistol

889
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:44,319
Set 3 is where the blank old man will look at Pizza

890
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:51,999
Those that leakage of information is going to like you

891
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:58,399
Exactly

892
01:01:58,655 --> 01:02:00,447
Then we accept

893
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:04,799
Otherwise

894
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:14,271
Whitsett with probability

895
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:16,575
Hey

896
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:20,671
Inspiration

897
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:22,975
Now what we mean by except

898
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:26,559
Except means

899
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:32,703
Reset x equal to

900
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:35,519
Sorry about that.

901
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:38,591
If we reject on the other hand

902
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:41,407
Which is what we do if we don't

903
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:43,199
Either of these tests

904
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:48,319
If we were Jack then what we do is we set XP + 1 equal to

905
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:53,183
XT so you repeat we stay where we are

906
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:55,487
We reject the proposed move

907
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:57,023
How we stay where we are

908
01:02:57,535 --> 01:03:00,095
And in this way we create a list

909
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:02,399
What's algorithm

910
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:07,263
Ask Polly mobile

911
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:10,079
Step step step step

912
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:15,967
Step

913
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:18,783
Same same place same the same place

914
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:20,319
Same same place

915
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:25,439
Stay the same place

916
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:30,559
Stainless steel plate

917
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:36,959
And this is generating .01

918
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:41,567
I want the point of that you might have

919
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:43,615
Bunch of that

920
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:48,991
Isotopically

921
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:51,039
Is

922
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:54,879
Sounds like caca

923
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:01,023
So let me show you

924
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:08,191
Rolepoint Staten topically

925
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:11,263
Will be coming from the red distribution

926
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:22,783
And I'm going to start a novelty .02 Top Ramen doesn't matter where it is we're going to run this thing for a long time

927
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:25,087
And what we do is

928
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:26,623
We stopped at that point

929
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:30,719
Mike shoe is always going to be a Galaxy and sent it on the carpet

930
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:33,535
And it shows

931
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:36,607
In Our IT services the X

932
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:39,167
Just done

933
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:41,471
Then we evaluate p

934
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:42,751
The new location

935
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:46,079
And we say what the ratio of P of the new location

936
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:48,127
At the current location

937
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:52,479
And by symmetry but you choose canceled

938
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:53,503
Proposal

939
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:54,527
Distribution

940
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:58,111
So these shoes are going to be the same as each other

941
01:04:58,367 --> 01:04:59,903
How big is a Galaxy in

942
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:01,951
Send it on me at you

943
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:03,999
How big is the galaxy

944
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:06,303
This place at your place

945
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:07,583
And those are

946
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:14,239
By symmetry the same as the ratio of these P what is it

947
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:18,591
Tea at the new location is bigger than 2 years

948
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:24,991
Current location

949
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:27,039
Generation X

950
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:31,903
Now we draw from Augustine send it on that point

951
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:35,487
Close the small set right

952
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:38,047
And it's Mula

953
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:42,399
So will it be accepted or not we don't know we have to draw another random number

954
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:45,471
Send coin with a biased essay

955
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:48,799
Is it acceptable and the answer is

956
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:52,639
Yeah but then Connie came out had to accept

957
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:58,271
We make another drawer next to

958
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:03,391
It takes a bit so we're going to accept this definitely

959
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:06,719
Lights

960
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:10,815
Now it's going down by big fact we've already started this new location

961
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:12,351
And the ratio is about

962
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:16,959
Wanted to tell

963
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:20,031
Glass of 50% chocolate what happens

964
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:22,591
Except

965
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:24,639
Go again

966
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:27,711
No change in peace I will accept that

967
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:33,599
So that was five steps of algorithm in every single set accept it

968
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:36,159
Which means that essentially we were just doing a random walk

969
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:37,183
On the Q

970
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:38,975
But if we run it for longer

971
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:44,607
Then you can see some rejection love each other

972
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:51,263
So you can see we spent more time in places where.

973
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:55,871
And we didn't do so much rejecting if I slap you with smoke

974
01:06:58,687 --> 01:07:02,015
The decision to reject moves

975
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:07,647
When you are in places where people take us to get more samples

976
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:11,743
If you run this thing

977
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:13,023
Trinity long

978
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:19,679
And then pick one pointy place at the very end

979
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:21,471
Many types of point

980
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:25,311
Thumbs

981
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:29,407
Distribution is ever closer to the registration

982
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:30,687
I love you Rhonda

983
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:34,271
So that's a beautiful property

984
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:39,391
At least with a lot of question marks though you don't know how long to run this thing so

985
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:42,207
Anjappar menu

986
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:47,583
As well

987
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:50,911
When you run it

988
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:59,871
N&d if you keep on running it for longer than substance

989
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:02,431
Independently

990
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:11,391
The probability distribution of any one of them

991
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:13,695
If you have enough

992
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:18,815
Okay

993
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:20,095
I'm not going to

994
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:21,119
Tell you about

995
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:22,143
Get something

996
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:29,055
I'm just sampling is

997
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:30,079
A

998
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:34,687
Michael Shane Macaulay method

999
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:37,759
Which only makes sense if we have two dimensions

1000
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:47,231
So what I'm going to talk about now is a problem that has two Dimensions namely

1001
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:50,815
The inference of the mean and the standard deviation or gas station

1002
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:52,351
Given n points

1003
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:53,887
I've got you

1004
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:57,215
So how does get something work

1005
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:03,103
I'll be done in 5 minutes

1006
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:17,695
Sampling

1007
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:25,631
This assumption is Mississippi

1008
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:28,703
Miss you

1009
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:31,775
That even though

1010
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:34,591
T itself is a redfish distribution

1011
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:36,639
Who assumed we can

1012
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:37,663
Sample

1013
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:39,455
Chrome

1014
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:43,807
Conditional distributions

1015
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:48,671
Long

1016
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:54,303
These Dimensions conditional on Ali Abbas Sophie is a nasty red thing

1017
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:57,119
Some complicated

1018
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:58,911
Shape

1019
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:00,703
The assumption is that

1020
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:04,031
Slice a bit hippy

1021
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:07,615
Text to XOXO at 5

1022
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:15,039
And just let me let you draw from this conditional distribution

1023
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:18,367
Andro4all trx-1

1024
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:22,975
Even in the case of us

1025
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:25,023
Problem weather of two variables

1026
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:29,375
Stop somewhere

1027
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:35,263
Drool

1028
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:42,175
Text ones you value from the conditional distribution of X1 given x 2

1029
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:43,199
It's cheap

1030
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:51,135
Lindru x + 1 value of X2

1031
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:57,023
Devon you value so you take the new value

1032
01:10:57,279 --> 01:11:01,631
And then

1033
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:07,263
How you do it with the two variable pay variable

1034
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:12,127
You just Cycles are you doing each of them from his distribution conditional

1035
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:19,295
Assumption that you can do this but there are examples where this is quite easy and the cast

1036
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:22,111
Is a good example outfit

1037
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:29,279
If I give you some data is Phi Beta Sigma

1038
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:30,559
The answer to that you can

1039
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:36,191
And you right. It's a dependent

1040
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:40,031
Distribution where

1041
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:46,687
Call hosain concentric

1042
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:48,223
Looks like

1043
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:51,039
But any slice through this is fantastic

1044
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:58,207
Even though this is a dependent distribution slicing misdirection

1045
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:03,327
Sliced in this direction

1046
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:04,863
Denisa Gamez

1047
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:06,911
Unreasonable

1048
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:14,079
And as long as you have a piece of software that controls distribution you can do each of these steps

1049
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:16,895
You want then the other one

1050
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:26,111
In red I'm showing you what the distribution Happy Looks like that multiplying whole plan cost

1051
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:30,975
Rochester

1052
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:37,375
I'm showing you in Texas pay this looks like

1053
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:39,679
Cassian with meaning

1054
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:45,055
And then you tell him okay update you by drawing it from the gasoline distribution

1055
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:46,335
Which

1056
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:50,687
Leaving Sigma fix to this road value

1057
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:55,551
He can draw from that guy

1058
01:12:56,063 --> 01:12:58,111
What's the conditional distribution mean

1059
01:12:58,367 --> 01:12:59,135
Given Sigma

1060
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:01,951
Nazi swastika

1061
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:04,255
And then the second step

1062
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:07,327
Is update Sigma

1063
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:10,911
I need Rosa from gamma distribution

1064
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:12,191
And that changes the

1065
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:16,543
Standard deviation from the volume randomly

1066
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:17,567
Penny value

1067
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:19,103
Tell me update to me

1068
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:22,431
Me and

1069
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:29,087
And there's a dependence between

1070
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:33,951
Every other set i'm highlighting in yellow when we come through

1071
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:47,263
Norfolk running and you can see and yellow what was happening

1072
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:50,847
Is a summary of what happened

1073
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:56,223
Surround

1074
01:13:57,503 --> 01:14:00,575
Disappearance this is a metropolis message

1075
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:06,207
No

1076
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:07,999
You can do this

1077
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:11,327
A whole range of models

1078
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:13,631
And the mobile that we discussed

1079
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:18,239
In the previous life why we believe Satan comes from

1080
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:19,775
A mixture of Gaskins

1081
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:23,359
Siletz now change station

1082
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:25,407
Is a new dataset

1083
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:26,943
Fishing points

1084
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:31,295
Can you conceive it looks like

1085
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:33,087
And then maybe there's a protocol

1086
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:42,047
If we insist on saying there is only one gas can then we can use

1087
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:43,071
The

1088
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:47,679
Get something method to draw from the posterior probability

1089
01:14:49,983 --> 01:14:56,127
Look at the whole bunch of theories about you and sigma silica

1090
01:14:57,407 --> 01:15:02,527
That's something else we can do is we can change them

1091
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:03,551
Is it Asia

1092
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:09,951
Yeah we have

1093
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:24,799
Denote

1094
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:27,103
What plug is it sometimes

1095
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:32,991
I'm representing now about to dance to

1096
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:38,367
I hope this is the two of them

1097
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:40,159
And yellow and orange

1098
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:44,511
Some of these two guys in Hawaii

1099
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:46,815
That's what you get when you have those two

1100
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:49,119
The dates are shown in blue

1101
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:54,239
And then in orange and yellow I'm showing which point to be analogous to which

1102
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:57,311
Vacations

1103
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:02,175
And now what we do is we're going to alternate between

1104
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:04,735
And we will call

1105
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:06,783
Signing

1106
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:09,855
Just like it's okay me

1107
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:15,743
So we can chat using give something

1108
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:18,303
We're going to do is follow this

1109
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:19,583
Industrial air

1110
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:25,727
Update me the sun deviations in this way in this way

1111
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:27,519
And that corresponds to

1112
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:28,287
Assigning

1113
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:42,623
Eration

1114
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:46,207
We look at 3 p.m.

1115
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:50,303
We update on me to the standard deviation using the gasoline distribution

1116
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:52,351
Appropriate Army

1117
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:56,191
Given the points that happiness is be just like in the previous Batman

1118
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:59,519
I'm up safety standard deviation using a guy

1119
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:03,359
Each of the costumes does that or sell

1120
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:09,247
I'm Amazed by working out the

1121
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:15,647
Responsibility but you accusing

1122
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:18,975
Just looking at those socks responsibilities

1123
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:24,607
You actually draw from the band coin with those points

1124
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:25,887
Make a penny coin

1125
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:28,447
I belong to you now

1126
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:31,519
So you can see at least

1127
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:33,567
It's time to change it

1128
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:35,871
Orange

1129
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:37,151
And then

1130
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:42,527
Mister yellow

1131
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:46,623
Orange

1132
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:47,903
Hansford

1133
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:50,975
Fungi

1134
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:57,887
I'm just now exploring weho

1135
01:17:58,143 --> 01:18:02,751
The posterior distribution

1136
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:04,287
On this

1137
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:09,919
Really is

1138
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:14,527
Sorry I missed your Gaskins

1139
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:15,295
Prom date

1140
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:17,599
YouTube this is you can do it

1141
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:22,975
They're usually bitter taste to have any positive

1142
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:28,095
Grow exponentially with you

1143
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:31,679
The number of me

1144
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:32,703
Up doing

1145
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:39,359
K means clustering and it doesn't suffer from some of the defects

1146
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:42,175
Get something

1147
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:47,039
Is essentially a randomizer

1148
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:53,695
That's something you can notice is in a green I'm showing what the average is

1149
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:55,487
Stimulation

1150
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:58,559
It said that reading is the answer to the question

1151
01:18:58,815 --> 01:19:03,679
Please predictable me where the next point the 14th

1152
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:11,615
Green line is a very nice prediction

1153
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:19,551
Listen to run it for a very long time

1154
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:26,207
You would see a split happening every now and then the moment Mr yellow is the cost of is usually responsible

1155
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:31,839
And doesn't equally probable hypothesis oranges or something for them

1156
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:33,119
Edit the other way around

1157
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:40,543
Logically it must be able to get to that around

1158
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:46,687
Mystery run it provides another 15 minutes

1159
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:48,479
Then you'll see it

1160
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:51,551
Probably Rick Ross

1161
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:58,207
Between those two exclamation

1162
01:20:03,839 --> 01:20:04,351
Okay

1163
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:09,471
I'll leave it running on the end of it

1164
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:12,031
First lecture on Monte Carlo methods

1165
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:13,567
All that any

1166
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:15,104
Questions.

1167
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:25,600
Okay so the question is

1168
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:32,256
What about if you wanted to know how many classes The Rock if you want to know how many clusters

1169
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:37,376
You would have to

1170
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:38,400
Represent

1171
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:40,960
Poster distribution all

1172
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:48,128
Weather news

1173
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:53,504
That is a much harder thing to work with because essentially it has to include that normalizing

1174
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:59,136
Mustang Monte Carlo method

1175
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:04,768
They don't tell you the normal I think I'm not get your tit but if you wanted to answer question

1176
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:09,632
These methods

1177
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:11,680
Revealed

1178
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:14,240
That almost color method

1179
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:16,032
Estimate

1180
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:22,176
Correctly play transition

1181
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:26,016
These things exist

1182
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:31,136
They are much more respected

1183
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:34,208
Come along next time and maybe we can

1184
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:36,768
Meet

1185
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:40,608
Next lecture let me just tell you where it where we going

1186
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:43,680
So I'll show you a demo get something

1187
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:45,472
The web genie

1188
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:47,264
Halfway through

1189
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:50,336
This particular set of Monte Carlo method

1190
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:57,248
And the message was showing you served three important problems

1191
01:21:57,504 --> 01:22:03,392
Call T-Mobile Challenge number for 3 challenges around

1192
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:09,792
Michael Chambers

1193
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:16,448
So what we would like his message but have less running Behavior

1194
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:24,896
The methods tend to be sensitive Stepside so when we are using

1195
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:31,808
But while it's dirty make small changes but that means it makes more sense between debate

1196
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:38,720
Very slow progress you'd like to take biggest that you always reject

1197
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:48,192
I said problem with everything we've seen so far as we don't know when to stop you don't know when we run it along enough

1198
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:50,752
We have reached

1199
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:54,848
And all three of a problem

1200
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:58,944
Fishing methods Behavior

1201
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:04,832
Rid of sensitivity

1202
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:06,112
The step size

1203
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:12,768
And we're going to discuss a method called exact sampling which is Amazing Grace written

1204
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:19,168
Taking some must not be being able to approve of recite this point is a correct drawer

1205
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:30,432
So exact something is up a really huge breakthrough

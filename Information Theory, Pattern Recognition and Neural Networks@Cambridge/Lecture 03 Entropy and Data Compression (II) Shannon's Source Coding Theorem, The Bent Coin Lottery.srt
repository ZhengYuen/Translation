1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:05,376
Walking directions to re

2
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:07,168
We'll talk about sauce

3
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,984
Coding orthodontist data compression

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:16,384
The big picture is in lecture one I introduced you to the middle of the course noisy Channel coding

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,784
Step back and think about how to measure information content and how that relate to doing data compression

6
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:29,440
And for two topics for today are we going to continue examining the evidence for the assertion that

7
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,768
The Shannon information content which I burned down here

8
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:35,840
Is the right way to measure information content

9
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:41,984
We will prove to Source coding therapy that actually proves that

10
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:45,312
The sun information content is the

11
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:50,944
Will SketchUp roof the details are in the

12
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:54,784
So

13
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:01,184
What disgusting how to compress redundant files and as a toy example of a redundant file

14
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,488
You could imagine

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,144
An alphabet with just two possible car doesn't it is 0 and 1 Generation by tossing a bent calling

16
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,984
Has a nice chance of coming up 0% chance of coming up

17
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:21,408
So that's an example of a very simple toy redundant file and we'll talk more about that

18
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,176
If you cuss

19
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,296
The general claim is the son of information content of an outcome

20
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:30,624
Is a sensible way to measure how much information

21
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,672
That outcome gives you

22
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:38,048
Add if you take the average of the Shannon information content you get the entropy

23
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:44,448
And the second claim is the entropy is a sensible measure of expected or average information content

24
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,616
We

25
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:54,176
Discuss the last time a first

26
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:58,528
Experiment if you like a first case study

27
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:03,392
For testing these claims about but kind of information cannot be looked at the weigh-in problem

28
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:09,792
And must be going to try and Foal billing problem struggle a bit and think about it quite a lot

29
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:13,120
Maybe after a couple of days struggling they still haven't got the answer

30
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:19,520
And the Shannon information from 10 gives you an idea where it says if you want info with it why or why not choose one

31
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,800
Not with maximum entropy

32
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:26,432
When you follow that principle you got a solution that got you done in three Wayne just fine

33
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:30,272
Out of a 12-volt which one is the old one and heavy or light

34
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:32,320
In 3 weighings

35
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,856
And that's all it needs

36
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:40,256
And that's the best you can do and so it's a it's a little piece of evidence that hey maybe this

37
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,792
We think it's useful

38
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,120
If you don't choose

39
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:51,520
The waiting at each step that has the maximum possible entropy that you are going for a strategy that

40
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:54,336
Does not guarantee to get you done in free

41
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,384
It's a good idea

42
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:59,200
Probably think about entropy

43
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:07,136
Deferred payment going to discuss is the seal coating serum that says it if you guys got a big string of N Out

44
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,672
Outcomes from a source

45
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,976
Then they can be compressed

46
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,792
Into roughly n times the entropy

47
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:14,816
This

48
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,120
Sir

49
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:22,240
I asked you last time to have a think about the bent coin Lottery

50
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,520
Puzzle

51
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:27,872
We'll come back to this very soon the best coin laundry in voles

52
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:32,992
Nothing's been calling a thousand times to determine which is the winning ticket and if you

53
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,552
And the winning ticket you win a gazillion pounds

54
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:42,208
And the question I asked you was if the mafia boss tells you that you must buy enough

55
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:46,304
Tickets from the shop to guarantee a 99% chance of winning

56
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,704
The price which tickets would you buy assuming that you try to minimize the cost of the tickets they cost you a quid

57
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,728
H

58
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:58,080
And how many tickets would that add up to

59
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:04,480
Okay so we'll come back to the first one to look at to slightly simpler example

60
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:10,880
Two more little games to think about these claims about the showing information contact the first game is

61
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:13,184
Code 63 and it works progress

62
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:19,583
In 63 I think of a number and the number is drawn from this hat is everyone...

63
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,607
63

64
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,143
So I pick a number

65
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:27,007
And then you ask me questions and I say yes or no to go questions

66
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,799
And when you know what it is

67
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:31,103
How do you say I know X

68
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:35,455
How to talk to your neighbor

69
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:41,599
What strategy would you use to try and identify the number I'm thinking of

70
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:44,927
As rapidly as possible using as few guesses as possible

71
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,535
Okay who'd like to suggest a way of

72
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,607
Ask a guy asking questions to

73
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,631
Play the sky

74
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,423
I don't be shy

75
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,567
Okay

76
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:06,687
So your first question could be is X bigger than or equal to 32

77
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,039
How's your day and I could say

78
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:14,623
Yes and then your next question will be

79
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:27,423
I can't is it in the range 48 to 63 and I could say no

80
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:34,079
I keep on having and you're getting for simple eye-popping you just continue as warm

81
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:40,479
Ask your second question for you in a general way you could ask for edx modulo 32

82
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:44,831
Number greater than or equal to 16

83
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,111
Okay

84
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:46,879
Enat

85
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:53,791
Xbox X32 means throw a 32

86
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:59,679
Alright so this answer the first question was yes which I could go Wong

87
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,727
Second question was 0

88
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:04,543
Question is going to be his ex

89
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:09,407
Body like 16 or equal to

90
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,943
Marketside

91
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,295
And then he'd ask

92
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:20,415
Is X mode

93
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,463
And I might say no

94
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:29,631
Like I need to keep on going and going and you ask this phone

95
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,959
How do I say yes

96
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,495
Pioneer

97
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:40,895
The X1 July 4th pick 2

98
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:46,015
The same as asking is it an even or an odd number

99
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,807
And I might tell you

100
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,087
No

101
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,623
Analogy day

102
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,047
Okay

103
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:01,375
I'm what I'm answer is 42

104
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,911
Because what you

105
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:09,311
Nitrostat is 101010 is 42 in binary

106
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:18,271
I don't got any comments questions everyone with me

107
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,831
Okay

108
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:24,671
Suck a solution to the game of 63

109
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,207
And

110
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:29,279
An observation we can make is that

111
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:35,167
If you want to be sure of identifying an outcome in this alphabet

112
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:41,311
Then it will take you six binary questions to be sure by identifying it

113
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:48,735
We could also have a think about these Clayton what The Shining information comes I bet School answers

114
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:51,807
What's the first question wrong

115
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:55,903
C2 C3 C4 and song

116
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,439
Questions

117
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:10,239
What was the Shannon information content of each of these answers

118
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:15,103
Well it's time you asked the question question

119
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:18,687
You didn't know what I was thinking also it was 50/50

120
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,479
Well dance with me

121
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:26,111
So the Shannon information content open.com walls

122
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:31,231
Log base 2 1 over the provision of outcome which was a hawk whatever happened

123
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,535
So that's love II

124
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,839
Cheap one bed

125
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:44,031
So the total information content according to Shannon that you got total

126
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,311
Heinen

127
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,615

When making a connection to session

138
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:41,887
If you got an outcome you can compress it into 6 bit

139
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,775
And 6 bit to shine information content and it's all making sense there's nothing very surprising Happening Here

140
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,847
Text of this is very weak evidence

141
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,127
The idea yep

142
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,943
Shannon information content is looking promising

143
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,319
Why was it a good strategy to split

144
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:04,159
It into switch everything into some people

145
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,231
So why don't you ask first is it a prime number

146
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:10,303
Why is it a good idea to split exactly into

147
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:21,055
It got Maxim information content maximum expected information contact the probability

148
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,847
I wouldn't be

149
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,871
Haha

150
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:30,527
I'm trying to say hey you're not getting as much expected information that you could cause a channel Samsung like the

151
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:36,927
In the big sat out of the two to go crashing can talk to 7:15 then

152
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,719
You're going to need more than

153
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,535
The remaining whatever it would it be in 5 questions

154
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,583
Okay

155
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:50,239
Let's ask you one more question based on this game and then do another game

156
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,031
All right

157
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,823
Suck it the question

158
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:57,663
If I cover sets with s possible outcomes in it

159
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:04,063
How many bits long must each name be if every outcome is going to have a unique name

160
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:08,159
The question is I have got a drawer full of

161
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,719
Underwear at home

162
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:23,519
I don't want to be Farrah and systemic can give every one of these a unique name so I can record on Facebook which player

163
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,799
I'm wearing today

164
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,615
Talking to right little names on them

165
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,151
And the question is

166
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:33,247
If I'm going to post on Facebook the

167
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:39,647
Binary name of each of these items

168
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:47,327
Capital S different pieces of underwear

169
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:53,727
How long does each of these binary names have to be assuming I give them oil binary names of the same

170

Okay

173
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,967
How long do my labels need to be

174
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,015
To label my underwear

175
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:09,087
An outcome from the set, uncoded

176
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,647
Healthy communication in how many bits

177
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,695

00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:31,359
But we're going to round it up a bit in case this isn't an integer longer 64 or 6

181
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,895
Which is nice and convenient

182
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:36,223
In general logos 67 or something

183
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:42,879
We'll have to round it up a bit so maybe you need to go up by almost 1 and weak feeling

184
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:46,719
Symbol hand means ceiling

185
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,255
Which means

186
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,327
Take this number rounded to the nearest integer

187
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,607
Okay

188
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:59,007
Telogis is definitely the spirit of the arm sore after and if we're being obsessive we stealing longest

189
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,055
Rachel hunt net worth

190
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:04,895
We got the right temperature

191
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:11,295
An outcome from a certain size asked if you give them all names of binary

192
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:17,439
This outcome can be communicated and low base to pass

193
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:21,279
Burrell

194
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:24,095
Okay time for another game

195
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:31,263
This is a game based on battleships but a slightly more boring game

196
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,847
It's called submarine

197
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:41,503
Man submarine Wong submarine is hidden somewhere in the ocean and then have to stop firing at it just like in bed

198
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:44,575
Tips to try and find the wrong submarine

199
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,927
So let's run submarine

200
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,487
Hair It Is

201
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:59,423
Sucks let's have a game Sally built in some Shannon advice so who can see

202
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:05,823
For every possible thing we could do hair you can fire a tiny Square tells you what the probability of getting

203
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:12,223
Yes but you hit the submarine submarine is just one square of 64

204
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:15,039
63 / 64 that's right

205
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:21,439
It's 67-64 for the square

206
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,207
Better with time

207
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,743
Marinas

208
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:28,351
Actually fire this crap and

209
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:34,751
It will keep in track what was the probability of the outcomes that happened Greenwich is no no

210
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,591
The answer for that first outcome

211
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,615
Is

212
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,015
The probability

213
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,319
That response number one

214
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,855
Was no

215
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:53,183
What is 63 / 64

216
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:57,791
So The Shining information content of that first

217
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:04,191
How come is log base 2 of one over that which is lowest 264

218
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:04,959
63

219
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,007
All right

220
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:10,335
And that's a Slightly bizarre

221
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:16,479
Number 0.02 to 7

222
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:23,391
At what kind of trivial examples weighing problems

223
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,695
We looked at

224
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:29,023
Identifying underwear with fiber strings

225
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:35,679
I got you a 63

226
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,959
Uneven

227
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:41,055
Shannon says when you find out square in no

228
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,919
You got this much information .022 7 fix

229
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:50,015
But it's not obvious

230
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,039
Okay

231
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:53,343
Charlottetown playing and see what happens

232
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:59,743
Africa

233
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,511
53

234
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:06,143
And the public you know it's 62 every 60 take a shower fire

235
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,191
Boom what happened

236
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:15,359
The probability of getting another is what happened

237
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,895
2 / 63

238
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:22,271
Shannon information content with log face to event

239
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,551
Which was

240
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,599
Slightly more

241
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,391
But no

242
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,183
5

243
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,719
Sorry.

244
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,279
North

245
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:39,423
3 and the right-hand column is keeping track of the total information we've gained so far let's

246
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,215
Write that down

247
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,263
Dwell

248
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:52,223
Turtle information gained so far

249
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,343
6311

250
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,647
62

251
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:07,071
I carry on playing all of these

252
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,631
Maybe if we could have suggested

253
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,679
Dying for a little while

254
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:18,079
We could go if I can find fire this way but the probability of snow is One Republic

255
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:23,711
And that would give us no information content and nothing happens

256
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,159
Hahaha

257
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,975
Okay what's happened so far.

258
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,559
Half of the squares

259
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:45,471
And what's happened to the Shannon information content when you add it all up so far I got lots and lots of nose

260
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:48,799
Who's in the final long that I've just asked

261
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:52,895
Is log 33 / 32

262
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:59,295
Samantha Shannon information

263
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,183
What's going on

264
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,463
Well

265
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,279
It's a bit like playing 63

266
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:16,191
And choosing to ask question is the number one hit song

267
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:22,591
Very silly sausage in 63 and we got home late or is it his

268
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,359
Fetty WAP

269
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,895
And the answer is

270
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,687
No it's not that

271
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:31,807
And the great thing about this and that's just the same as asking

272
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,599
Is it less or equal to

273
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,159
Which

274
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:39,999
This is consistent with what we already felt was completely obvious

275
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:44,607
All right so that's promising this lot has ended up to

276
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:50,751
One bit very painfully acquired information content but it makes complete

277
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,031
Sense

278
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,127
Okay

279
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,367
Okay

280
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,415
What happened

281
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:12,255
La love

282
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:18,655
32 / 31 and what attempt was did this

283
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:26,335
Well we would just about to expect another know it would had a probability of

284
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:28,383
19 / 20

285
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,943
Latest thing we just

286
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:36,575
Did the Gullah know information competitive log

287
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:39,903
But then amazingly

288
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:46,303
We got a sudden enormous flu full .3

289
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,351
Send information contact over something

290
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,447
It feels a little bit

291
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,775
How much is it'll add up to

292
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,055
Look

293
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:00,383
Chex Mix

294
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:08,319
Hey I thought that expects we found the submarine we found which number I can 63

295
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,879
The computer was thinking of

296
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:14,207
Why did it come to such a beautiful routing number was that

297
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:18,815
Some special coincidence or does it always happen but let's just

298
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:23,679
Checkr report occasion

299
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:28,031
S&S I'm blessed I'm blessed I'm blessed

300
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:30,591
Preventative

301
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:36,479
Unless unless I'm so the answer is always going to come out once you found

302
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,807
Submarine Malone face tattoo

303
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:43,647
64

304
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,487
Look at that snow proof

305
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:53,887
But it's a nice little bit of evidence that maybe this log of 1 of A P thing which looked a bit strange beginning

306
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:59,007
Maybe that is the right way to measure how much information you got when something happens

307
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,055
You want to play again

308
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:05,151
Maybe not any questions

309
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,711
Okay

310
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,015
So that submarine

311
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,807
Now that there's been calling Lottery

312
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:16,159
Suck the question is the mafia boss tells you

313
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,464
To buy tickets

314
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,864
The outcome is going to be the string that is obtained when the coin is tossed

315
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,680
1000 * it's been calling

316
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:33,312
Redheads and common tiles

317
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:37,920
You can buy any of the tickets you want from the box office

318
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,712
If you roll

319
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:42,784
The winning ticket then you got a gazillion pounds

320
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,856
And the mafia boss forces you to buy

321
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:49,184
Lotto tickets in Oakland have a 99% chance

322
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:55,584
What are the questions I'm going to ask you if instead the rule of being forced to buy one ticket

323
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,864
Stop pounding.

324
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,144
To go and spend it

325
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,448
Which ticket would you buy

326
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:02,240
Have the best chance of winning

327
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,520
Then

328
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:09,408
Question 2 is going to be have a 99% chance of winning which tickets would you buy and how many tickets is that

329
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:16,064
And please express your answer in the form 2 ^ something that's three questions

330
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,832
For you

331
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:21,184
Please answer all of these questions

332
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,720
I want the board

333
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:28,608
Okay let's start with the simple question

334
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:31,680
You're forced to buy one ticket from the shop

335
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,216
Which

336
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:35,776
Ticket would you buy

337
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,312
Penny Wong

338
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,944
The old man I was ticket

339
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:49,344
Is

340
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,720
Anyone want a different ticket

341
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,048
Really

342
00:22:59,328 --> 00:22:59,840
Yeah

343
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:09,568
What is 900 + 101

344
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:12,384
Chat

345
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:17,504
Does the older I get

346
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,832
Which one would you would you buy

347
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,624
Which of these

348
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,488
You don't mind

349
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:31,328
I'll take one for you I'll take this one

350
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:46,944
Are you happy with this choice of would you like a different one

351
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:49,760
It's up to you

352
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:59,232
You like the most spread out I can't

353
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:05,888
Okay I'll give you one where the most for that

354
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,104
Okay we could still have the details

355
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:21,504
But we would come up with a particular answer whether spread out until you say you're happy and then we sell it to you for

356
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,296
Okay

357
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:28,928
Let's run the lottery now and see which of these tickets

358
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:35,328
When Sarah got a choice of three we could go this too today this is be mrs. tickets

359
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:41,728
So I got a computer and computer the great running lotteries

360
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,800
So

361
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,336
Nautilus submarine

362
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:50,176
I'm his v card for running a lottery

363
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:52,992
U-Pick and

364
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,528
You said f

365
00:24:54,784 --> 00:25:00,928
And you do a loop and time spitting out zeros and ones

366
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:06,048
Look like I'm going to run it runs and times to see who wins

367
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:14,240
To make it a little bit faster because you might anticipate that it would take a long time to actually run this Law Firm

368
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:20,640
Might have too many thousands of simulations before we go anywhere this I'm going to change and

369
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:26,016
Will change into 20 I'm going to use the same kind

370
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:32,672
All right I'm going to take the liberty of updating the answers you've given me so group

371
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:37,792
Who liked the old heroes ticket out using the old zero tickets till

372
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:45,216
3br voting for the one that has to office immediately followed by

373
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:47,776
18 zeros

374
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:48,800
Okay

375
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,688
Andrew Percy

376
00:25:54,944 --> 00:26:01,088
This is your chance to say what you want you can read it out to me if you want I'll make it up for you

377
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:04,416
Then you can say if you want a different one

378
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:10,304
Speak speak speak

379
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,096
Is that alright

380
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,376
That long

381
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,496
Hi okay. Two wrongs in it

382
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:21,824
If you want to 10% and you wanted them spread out

383
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:25,408
Join a different one we're about to run the lottery this is your chance

384
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:29,760
Okay I'm the winner gets a chocolate biscuit

385
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:34,624
But you're not allowed to eat in the election

386
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:41,536
I'm going to keep running it in fact because if we just had a winner that was the luck of the draw

387
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:44,864
I'm going to run until someone has run 10 times alright

388
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,168
And then we'll see how everyone else did

389
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:53,824
Yeah if you wanted a right so this group

390
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:00,224
Let's Get Rich As for me and you can check to see whenever they happen will keep count

391
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,552
Until someone is 1/10 times already

392
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,368
Hahaha

393
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:11,744
Surrounded that night we got a warning about variable names

394
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,304
So that's the first one

395
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:18,912
All right no one chest just don't get it right

396
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,704
Second lottery ticket

397
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,752
FreeOnes goodness make

398
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,848
Who won one

399
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,384
K

400
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,944
Hahaha

401
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,760
Hello what the LeBrons

402
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:38,368
Okay turkey pan

403
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:43,232
If you've had one win the ticket

404
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,536
As Roma two wrongs

405
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:47,328
I want to talk to you on

406
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:52,704
What's wrong with that was to

407
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,240
I want to talk to you wrong

408
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:57,056
Second wind

409
00:27:57,312 --> 00:28:01,152
I also got three this week up to

410
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:05,248
This is. 322 warm

411
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,528
1 long

412
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,808
One one

413
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,648
Reruns for Wee Ones

414
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:16,256
Hey how many of you want so far group a

415
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,560
3 winds well-done

416
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,352
But you're just lucky on you

417
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:27,008
QuikTrip

418
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,800
Nachos but I think being delayed

419
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,080
McKay

420
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:37,248
Oh that sucks Pokemon you see that

421
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,784
But

422
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,088
They had an extra one Ono

423
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,928
1006

424
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,232
7

425
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,472
How many begotten

426
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:58,752
9

427
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:10,272
Okay so what happened with had 10 wins

428
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:12,064
For this ticket

429
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,136
Knowing for the Swannanoa and so that one

430
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:17,952
All right so what was the last dinosaur

431
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:24,352
Looks like he was a good choice or ticket is the most probable ticket

432
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,376
This

433
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:27,936
A much higher chance of two woman coming up

434
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:34,848
That is very improbable thing having no one's at all so that intuition is absolutely right that you're not expecting the old

435
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:38,944
You are expecting typically to Wong's

436
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,968
Something

437
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,760
But the most powerful ticket

438
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,296
Is the old zero ticket

439
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:46,624
All right so what was Christian

440
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:47,904
2

441
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:51,488
If you have 99% chance of winning at lowest

442
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:56,096
Which tickets would you buy have another chat to your neighbor

443
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,800
I'm going with Anna's a thousand again

444
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:16,064
Okay I already heard of chocolate biscuits

445
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,928
Send it for talking so whoever suggested deal zero ticket gets one at the end

446
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,464
I know

447
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:26,560
Got a 99% chance of winning

448
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:36,032
Which tickets would you buy

449
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,312
Speak up

450
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:41,920
Yeah

451
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:58,560
Okay so you would buy the older or ticket

452
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:01,632
Only one

453
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:04,960
0 tickets 10

454
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:07,264
Tickets

455
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,824
One one

456
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,104
Well then

457
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,920
Boulevard one

458
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,968
Full movie

459
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:18,016
To Milan

460
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:19,808
Tickets

461
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,344
Find

462
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:29,536
Okay which is where I want to eat you already said you got

463
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,352
So give me a bit more information

464
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:40,800
Okay they didn't add up to some and what do you anticipate is going to be

465
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:43,360
Let's call it movie

466
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:45,920
CarMax

467
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:48,736
Juan

468
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:55,136
Tickets I'm introducing a babbling now going to happens when the lottery

469
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:55,904
Run

470
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:03,328
You're going to buy movie tickets will it take to have all Max

471
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:10,496
One's on the roughly what the max needs to be if you do that calculation you described involving a

472
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:14,592
Probability distribution

473
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:17,664
Binomial distribution again

474
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:18,688
Good

475
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,224
Roughly

476
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,760
What are mikes

477
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:30,976
Something like two to the 100 the baby okay so you'll talk me the number

478
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:35,328
Tickets that you need to buy I'm asking what does Max need to be sorry

479
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:38,912
120th

480
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:40,960
Okay

481
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:42,240
Set

482
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,800
Why 120 ish

483
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:59,648
The standard deviation of the number of ones that we got

484
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,672
Okay

485
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:12,960
Okay see you in 4 to send the deviations

486
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:18,848
Around the mean the mean number of 1 is 100

487
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:25,248
And the variance is an F1 - 1/2

488
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:31,392
Pictures of 1000 * 1.1 * 0.9

489
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:33,952
Which is roughly a hundred

490
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:36,512
But exactly 90

491
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:42,912
Which is roughly 10 Sigma the standard deviation is 10

492
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:47,264
Answer key to sanity be like you need to go

493
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:52,384
20 is 95%

494
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,432
The number of one's is going to be

495
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,480
100

496
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:59,808
Give at 8:20 so it's going to be between 80

497
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:00,832
120

498
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:07,744
I'm going to let you know that you all to buy bills Aerotek ticket even though it's very unlikely stay by everything down there as well

499
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,792
Because that's good value for money

500
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,096
But you stopped once you get up to

501
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,376
120

502
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:16,704
Navigate to a chance of winning of roughly

503
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,568
What's the probability that a normal variable

504
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:24,640
Is within two standard deviations

505
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:27,456
Have the main his long Sigma

506
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:29,504
Has two Sigma

507
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,808
Republican marriage

508
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,880
95%

509
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:37,184
What is 95% in that

510
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,816
And we've already bought this Taylor out here as well cuz it is the freaky lots of 0 tickets

511
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:46,144
What are the best value-for-money so the probability of its

512
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,192
And

513
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:54,848
Stylish 2.5% is 97.5%

514
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:58,176
Roughly if you buy all of these tickets movie

515
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,528
Suggesting or 121

516
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,320
Tickets

517
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:10,720
Write down a little bit. It's a hundred plus a small number

518
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:11,744
Compared with Android

519
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,048
How to K

520
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:20,960
Strategy and I think we're understanding what's a good strategy and now we need to know how many tickets is that

521
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:24,032
So if you buy this many tickets

522
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:28,384
How many oliveiro tickets are there is one how many Wong

523
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:31,200
Wang tickets

524
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:34,528
There's a thousand right

525
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:37,600
How many Q on tickets on

526
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,392
Thousand

527
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,928
Choose to

528
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:44,512
Which is more than a thousand bike light

529
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:48,096
Answer for how many hundred twenty

530
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:50,400
Wrong tickets all that

531
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:52,960
The number of them is

532
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:57,312
1000

533
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:59,360
Choose 120

534
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:03,712
So the number of tickets

535
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:05,248
Boss

536
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:13,952
Is 1 + 1000 + 2 + 8 + 1200

537
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:19,840
In the middle hair with the most probable value of which is 100

538
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:29,056
Okay I'm the question is is that something like 2 ^ 100 or not

539
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,688
Cactus big questions because this may be wrong

540
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:38,528
How to attach to each other

541
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,112
Which of these terms in the sum is the biggest

542
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:46,720
And what's a good approximation for is it to 200 or is it something else

543
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:54,144
Okay

544
00:36:55,168 --> 00:37:01,312
I've slightly corrected the answer we had a moment ago cuz remember buying everything up to the 121

545
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:07,968
Tickets only got you a 97% chance of winning in the rule what you could have a 99% chance so I've gone

546
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:14,880
The tickets that have 123 ones on them

547
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,928
Country standard deviations and that's what you need

548
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,280
Sucks in this series has a sum of terms

549
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:23,072
Which is the biggest

550
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:25,120
Roughly how big is it

551
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:27,424
Press which is the biggest

552
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:30,496
Right one

553
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:32,032
Any alternative answer

554
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,824
I don't think it's not

555
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,616
He thinks it is

556
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,456
OK Google okay

557
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:41,760
Stop this is right answer

558
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:48,160
If you plot a graph of and shoes which is that first Factor the binomial distribution

559
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:50,464
As all goes from 0

560
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:56,864
2 and becomes extremely big and then comes back down again and its biggest

561
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,888
And I would too

562
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:03,520
And we talked about the first up to here and then getting steadily bigger and bigger and bigger

563
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:05,312
We could hardly see them on this graph

564
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:08,128
But I do like the last one we just brought repair

565
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:09,152
Resume in

566
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:13,504
I got like that and that's the last one hits the biggest okay

567
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:16,064
How big is

568
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:18,368
This one Rock Lee

569
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:20,928
This is roughly 2 to the power something

570
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,720
And how big

571
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:25,280
Is this in the Forum

572
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,072
2 to the something

573
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:33,472
I think this is the biggest we don't really care about Lenny face we just want to know what's that number start with this one

574
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:36,544
Perhaps a little bit more familiar

575
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:40,384
Roughly what's 1000 choose 100

576
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:41,920
Anyone

577
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:46,016
2 to the power

578
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,576
800 something

579
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:51,904
Where did you get that from

580
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,584
Approximating

581
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:08,544
Okay so you approximated and factorial

582
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:14,944
And minus are factorial factorial

583
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:16,992
Okay

584
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:21,600
It's quite tricky the first time you do it maybe two bucks mate

585
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:28,000
Factorial and this

586
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,280
4

587
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:30,560
What

588
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:34,912
What happens when we approximate

589
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:36,704
This dude

590
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:40,032
Okay

591
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:43,104
500 - where do you get 500 from

592
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:50,272
Okay

593
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:54,880
So you're saying it through to the end times the entropy

594
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:57,440
All the distribution

595
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:00,768
Point warm, no point nine

596
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:04,352
W i k

597
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,400
Kiss

598
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:09,728
Let's check the book

599
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,288
Which I have encouraged you to read

600
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:15,872
And we go all the way into the book to page

601
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:17,408
1

602
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,504
I'm page one says

603
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:26,368
The binomial distribution and it talks about how to approximate the binomial distribution

604
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:29,184
And it has approximation

605
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,976
4 + Tucson

606
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:33,536
I can't indeed

607
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,352
How is the homework problem for you

608
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:38,656
To confirm

609
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:40,448
Love this thing

610
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:47,104
Is well approximated by an X we call it the binary function of Our Own

611
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,456
All right

612
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:58,624
Good

613
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:03,488
Lottery

614
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:11,168
This one's about 2,500 is actually more like to the 470 this one's a little bit bigger than 2 to the 500

615
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:13,984
It comes to true to the five

616
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,520
130

617
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:19,616
And in general if it's if it's a been the general

618
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:22,688
Length n

619
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:24,992
Lottery Robinhood 1000

620
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:26,016
Lottery

621
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:27,296
Then

622
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:31,392
The number of tickets you would have had to buy

623
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:35,744
I have a 99% chance for General and an s

624
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:56,223
To have a nice chance you would buy one.

625
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:58,271
And juice

626
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,599
FN

627
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:03,135
Pop a little bit

628
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:04,415
A little bit

629
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:10,815
Hit something on the lines of f- at times and square rooted with some factor out front like to

630
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:14,655
2.3 to make sure you got enough standard deviation

631
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:17,215
That many tickets

632
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:21,055
Which is approximately to the Past

633
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:21,823
And

634
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,615
X

635
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,407
The Byron Bay

636
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,175
Off

637
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,223
F

638
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:30,783
Plus something smoke

639
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,575
Plus something

640
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:35,135
Pascal's eyes be

641
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:37,439
Square root

642
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:39,487
Right

643
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,095
Sex

644
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:49,471
Reductant counting yes?

645
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:56,895
Okay the mafia boss gave you instructions the question is why you won't have the lowest possible cost

646
00:42:57,151 --> 00:43:01,247
That's because it's the rules getting invited not here he's paying for the tickets

647
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:04,575
He wants to minimize the cost every ticket cost one pound

648
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:05,855
Please

649
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:08,671
Spend the smallest amount of my money or I will kill you

650
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:14,815
And we must win the lottery early haven't proved to me that we have a 99% chance of winning or I will kill you

651
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:17,119
Okay that was the rules of the game

652
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:19,935
And now having followed his instructions

653
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:22,495
You get home and you have bought

654
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:29,151
This many tickets to Sao Paulo 550 tickets

655
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:32,479
I'm not now we're going to use

656
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:38,623
That result of how many tickets you bought to give us a crazy proof

657
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:40,415
Episource coding theorem

658
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:41,951
Okay

659
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,535
When you take those tickets home

660
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:48,095
Let me draw a picture of what you got

661
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:51,167
You've got yourself

662
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:52,959
A big bag

663
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,543
For the ticket

664
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:58,335
And every ticket

665
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:04,735
Has a great long string of ones and zeros on it and most of them have about 10% lungs

666
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:20,095
And it's a very long back for the tickets I'm bringing the tropical filter person

667
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:25,471
You decide to give every one of these tickets a shorter name

668
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:27,775
So you take every ticket

669
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:31,871
I need to turn it over I don't know if this side of that ticket

670
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:35,711
You write a shorter name

671
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:38,271
Which organ to write in binary

672
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:44,671
So the first one is Michael

673
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:46,719
Over to you

674
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:50,815
Replacement name which will be a shorter name of some lights

675
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:57,215
Here with me this is just because you're my father, it's like me and my underwear

676
00:44:57,471 --> 00:45:02,591
Recycle your ticket to turn them all over and on the back you're going to write a unique name for ticket

677
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,639
So that

678
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:11,039
When the winning ticket comes along you have a nice short name when you can post on Facebook the winning ticket had this name written

679
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,063
Reverse

680
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,623
Attack

681
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:19,743
If you do that

682
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:23,839
How long is it to be short names going to be on the reverse of the ticket

683
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:26,655
Yeah

684
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:31,775
Okay

685
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:36,383
Set the cost of about 2 to the 500 tickets in your bag

686
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:38,943
The length of this is the house

687
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:45,087
Is there a set of size tutu they 500 the length and needs to have the ceiling off to be today

688
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:46,879
500 vs 500

689
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:50,975
Set it is roughly 500 actually

690
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:52,255
We have to buy

691
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:59,935
So in this particular case is 530

692
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:06,335
Long opposite direction the front of the ticket has x on it the outcome that might happen

693
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:10,943
I'm at a thousand fitslim

694
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:14,527
Travessa got a short name 550 bit slow

695
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:17,599
Now what are you got

696
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:20,927
You've got yourself a practical compression

697
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:27,327
System for the vent point you got a compressor compressor

698
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:33,727
How does it work look impressive looks like this so you won the lottery for the

699
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:40,127
Boss you pay him the zillion pounds and then you keep the bag because the bag is your compressor

700
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:45,759
The way it works is whenever someone create the file using the Bank coin

701
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:48,063
Eureka bag

702
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:50,879
Can you find the bag of V winning ticket

703
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:54,207
But you're almost doesn't have in that 99% chance U

704
00:46:54,463 --> 00:47:00,607
You find the winning ticket and you write the short name and store that on the list

705
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:01,375
Strife

706
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:03,167
And then when someone says

707
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:06,495
Tell me that filed but you can press for me

708
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:14,431
Negative the zip file real telling you the short name on the back of the ticket and used

709
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:20,831
And you look in the bag back of every ticket until you find the wrong with that

710
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:25,951
Best name on it

711
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:26,975
Okay

712
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:33,887
That what we have shown is we can make a compressor on and on compressor let's go to 99%

713
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:40,287
Effects

714
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:45,919
We could have made it 99.9 just fine fastening that standard deviation little bit

715
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:52,319
The compressed length still would have be 500 plus a little bit now

716
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:55,647
It is just as the square root of an and that's relatively small

717
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:57,695
So what weekend

718
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:58,719
Michonne butt

719
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:01,791
And out comes from the coin

720
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:05,119
Can be compressed into roughly

721
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:10,495
And * the entropy of 0.9

722
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:12,031
Bets

723
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:17,151
Freetime compress

724
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:22,271
Capcom into

725
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:23,807
V money

726
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:30,463
Bits in a little for the batteries not included conditions apply in college

727
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:34,303
Deal with the √ and roughly

728
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:39,679
Which is bacillus coding Center and increasing the address

729
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:42,751
Statement like I said

730
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:49,407
Return compression. Comes into roughly at age fits and we proved this by counting the typical set

731
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:51,455
The book contains

732
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:57,855
The general rigorous proof of the source coding theorem for Dental Source not just the band coin

733
00:48:58,111 --> 00:49:04,255
The Hobbit chapter 4 if you want to see the full proof and the general definition of what we cool

734
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:10,655
Typicality typical set the typical set for the bent coin is old

735
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:17,055
Come here that which we expect to see most of the time so go down

736
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:20,895
A couple of standard deviations

737
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:27,039
This is the typical fat

738
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:33,439
On the precipice of skirting theorem depends on defining typicality and shoving that when and is very big

739
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:35,999
What usually happens is almost always

740
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:36,767
Typical

741
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:42,655
Next lecture

742
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,447
We're going to discuss

743
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:51,103
More practically have to do compression because you may be aware of the fact of how 500

744
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:54,431
Is substantially bigger than the number of electrons in the universe

745
00:49:54,687 --> 00:50:00,831
Service I call this a practical compressor well is not really fast and then the next lecture.

746
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:07,231
Real practical compression systems for trying to get close to what the source coding theorem proof

747
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:08,767
It's possible

748
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:17,471
I'd like to give you a project so you're thinking about this task already before I tell you the answer

749
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:19,007
All the answers

750
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:22,847
The project is please invent a compressor and turbine compressor

751
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:26,175
Which is a practical pair of systems

752
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:30,527
Assuming that we consult

753
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:36,159
And let's assume it's been calling for the probability of 1% of coming out

754
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:38,719
Alright I like you to implement

755
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:43,839
Your compressor and a compressor on a computer and or estimated value method

756
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:47,167
What I think it's the valuable exercise for you to do

757
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:49,983
As we move on to discussing practical compresses

758
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:53,311
Harrison recommended exercises and reading

759
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,591
From the book

760
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:56,383
Thank you very much for coming

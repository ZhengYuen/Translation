00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,704
Welcome to lecture 14

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,776
Today's lecture is about variational methods

3
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:18,176
We've been talked about methods for dealing with complication probability distributions we made have

4
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:23,808
Nasty probability distributions because we are doing inference and a posterior distribution is nasty

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,440
We may also have nasty probability distributions for other reasons maybe we work on physics

6
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:30,720
And

7
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:33,280
In the lectures we've discussed Monte Carlo methods

8
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
And now go to the methods which are two possible ways of dealing with nasty but someone

9
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:41,216
Tractable distributions

10
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:48,896
His the overview of all the chapters in The Textbook that we've been looking at for the election so far

11
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:55,808
I should emphasize that there's some additional reading I'd encourage you to do is very short chapter on laplace's method

12
00:00:56,064 --> 00:01:02,208
Which is another way of dealing with nasty distributions while you approximate the nasty distribution

13
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:03,488
Does a piece of reading for you

14
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:09,888
And from time to time I will refer to icing models as a good idea to have Radley chapter on icing bottles as well

15
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,168
Turn off the central

16
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,056
Websites for the book and for the course

17
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,224
And the other variational message looks like this assumption just as in Monte Carlo methods

18
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,528
There's a nasty red distribution

19
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:27,552
Kulfi

20
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:28,832
And

21
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:33,440
It's something that we can compute within a normalizing constant

22
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:39,072
Search for me to the -3 of X and we are able to compute e of x

23
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:45,728
And in very committed our assumption is the T-Rex is a fairly simple function but not quite simple

24
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:52,128
Enough for us to be able to actually answer the questions of Interest which all things like expected values of functions on the

25
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:59,552
Thought the idea of variational method well we introduced a simpler green distribution the record

26
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:06,720
And we parametrize that simply distribution in some way so Q is intended to be

27
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:11,328
Simple enough that we can evaluate expectations on interesting things on the Q

28
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:18,752
We make it adjustable and then we adjust the parameters of Q so that it is as close as possible by some

29
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:21,568
Metric to pee so we just leave promises

30
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,336
Pizza

31
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,896
To get the best approximation

32
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:28,480
And a very important question is going to be how do we Define best

33
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:31,040
Once we found that best approximation

34
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:34,112
Wilco Optimus Prime and his he just off

35
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,904
Then we can

36
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,304
Approximate the expected value of a function fire that we are interested in by the expected value

37
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:49,472
Right. See the big picture you can think of this is getting away from introducing random numbers it would

38
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:55,872
Message reset Opie's difficult but let's use some random numbers and some clever ideas and jump around index

39
00:02:56,128 --> 00:03:02,272
Space in some way and you might have thought why do I need to have extra random numbers in addition to

40
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:08,672
To the date of that I've gathered for my infant's problem it doesn't seem logical to need

41
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,696
Random numbers to

42
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,744
Answer my inference question

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,144
Answer variational method or an approach that says yes actually need random numbers

44
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,424
You can do this instead

45
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,192
Well

46
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:25,056
Whether it works well is is an open question

47
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,592
How we do this

48
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:31,456
So we need an objective function that measures how close Q is to pee

49
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,480
And

50
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:37,856
This various ideas for how to measure closeness of distributions to each other

51
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,624
And

52
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:45,024
To that we have already come across the cool white lie blood divergences between p and Q which you can ride

53
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,376
Like two different ways right so you can have the average on the Q of log2 of a p

54
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:55,776
Vlog beer with you and these are both measures of distance between p and Q

55
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,080
That have the property that when

56
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,896
Pnqi equal becomes I-30

57
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:06,784
And it can't get any smaller than that minimized if you cannot sleep perfectly matched

58
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:17,280
No we must remember that the extra talking about is a very high dimensional thing so these sums of x

59
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,559
That we have hair

60
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:24,959
Not necessarily easy to do I'm able to go we already agreed that P is difficult we come

61
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,495
Accurately

62
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,031
Represent averages

63
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:34,431
I'm for example for somebody who acts of 5x * 10x is a difficult thing so why should we think that we can

64
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,967
Can do anything with these

65
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,271
These K else

66
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:41,599
Before I

67
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:47,999
Continue with that thought let's just look at an example so you understand how these Kayo's work

68
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:54,399
A very very simple nasty read distribution which is non-uniform it's got a photo

69
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,935
Probability

70
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,703
4

71
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,983
Discrete functions

72
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:04,383
I'm in a spaceship and Q is a simpler distribution which is uniform across wrong

73
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,663
Opal prices

74
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,687
I would like you to

75
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,247
Quickly work out and discuss with each other

76
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,039
What's the

77
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,087
Kuba Kuba Divergence

78
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:19,487
Each way around so if you workout first one and the second one which of them is biggest and roughly how big are they

79
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,255
Please

80
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,535
Talk to you later.

81
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,911
Okay

82
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:30,751
Let's have some votes ISO On the Border

83
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:34,335
QP first and then PQ second

84
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,359
So

85
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:38,431
Let's have votes for which one is bigger

86
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:41,247
Is the first one bigger or is it smaller

87
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:44,831
Or do you not know if I swear I don't know I haven't had enough time

88
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,111
Okay

89
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:50,207
Votes for the first one is bigger than the second

90
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:56,607
Lots of folks that voted for its Moore ok

91
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,911
That is correct Sir William

92
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,543
I'll bring them in Delaware around for no particular reason healthy

93
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,335
Distance

94
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,871
Measure this way around

95
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,943
Is about log 4/3

96
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:18,367
Whereas if you have q on the outside Q goes in Columbus in and puts foot of its probability Macon

97
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:24,767
Play swipeys has no way that's Tonya Tonya probability and it gets strongly penalized for there in that

98
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,791
So

99
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,839
When you talk up

100
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:42,943
When you talk to your lucky repeat you got this one over at Salon which is very large

101
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,223
And

102
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:52,415
Bad news if you like if this is your measure of closeness and not says cute

103
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,951
Here is a very long way from p

104
00:06:55,999 --> 00:07:00,095
I'll put quotes on that kiss is it bad news

105
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,143
Depends on what we're trying to do

106
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:02,911
But

107
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,239
At least big

108
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:10,847
So something to be aware of if we use this source of objective function

109
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:15,711
Is if p is a complicated thing

110
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,479
Sorry

111
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,527
Complicated

112
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:22,623
Thing that in some places goes to zero and if we approximated by

113
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,439
A green thing

114
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,255
That is none 0 in places where p

115
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:32,095
Is actually zero or very very close to zero

116
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,911
This will be deemed a bad approximation

117
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,959
You got a very strong penalty

118
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,775
So if we optimize this

119
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,311
Objective function

120
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:44,383
The sort of thing you might expect to have happened

121
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:49,759
In this case would be that the green thing says I mustn't put a foot wrong

122
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,319
I'll make sure

123
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,695
Put any mass in places where p is 0 so you'll end up with a proximation that look

124
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,975
Like this

125
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,023
That's the sort of thing that happens

126
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,559
If you use

127
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,095
Some cute

128
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,119
Slug

129
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,911
2 / 30

130
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:14,079
On the other hand if you use something with Q as your objective function

131
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,359
Then

132
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:21,247
It's the other way around that you don't want to make the mistake of

133
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,783
Failing to put

134
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,623
Mass in the place where I pee has got Max and so if you use

135
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,183
This objective

136
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,999
Assuming you could compute it

137
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,607
This would lead to you

138
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:46,591
Taking a message of solution like this and maybe approximating it was something extremely broilers to make sure you kept it a little

139
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,663
Little blips

140
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,223
Okay

141
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:56,575
So it's good to understand injective functions we're talking about

142
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,159
No

143
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,255
The first one

144
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,303
Summerfield p over Q

145
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,327
Involves

146
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,351
Plumbing

147
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,679
Immoderately nasty thing

148
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:15,519
Under anesthesia distribution pay let's just rewrite it

149
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,823
With color

150
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,895
I have a stomach relaxer p

151
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,943
Log

152
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,503
Kiev

153
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:35,743
I'm giving that finding the expected value of a function on the pee is difficult it seems very unlikely that we

154
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:39,071
Going to be able to find the expected value of this function on the p

155
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,911
All right so even if we want to evaluate this one

156
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,727
It's for real song

157
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:48,031
We won't be able to evaluation

158
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,359
So let's give up on that straight away

159
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:56,223
And look at the other one so if we look at dkl

160
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:02,623
This involves the sum of q log Q

161
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:09,023
All of which is nice is nice and is under our control and then we have the one little bit of nastiness the red bit

162
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,071
His hair

163
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,863
And everything else is

164
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,399
Green or white

165
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,775
We could

166
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,591
Write this as

167
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,919
Assam / X

168
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:30,271
Qfx support during this time

169
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,575
Times the energy

170
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:41,023
Using the definition of t e of X is 8 - DMX

171
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,607
On that where that is an interesting number that we don't know

172
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,447
So if pulled out the E from here

173
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,775
What else do we have will have a zed please

174
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,847
Service log

175
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,383
They say of

176
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,175
Red LED

177
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:02,527
And then what leftover is the entropy of Q

178
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:06,879
Which alkyl HQ off apps

179
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,183
I can give as a greeting

180
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,719
Tinge

181
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:18,655
So is this hopeless as well is it impossible to evaluate this well this is the average

182
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,703
Of a function under Q

183
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:26,335
And maybe that is on maybe we can do it it's easy but

184
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,383
Brunch

185
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,663
So maybe that's okay

186
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,503
Best we would love to know

187
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:39,135
But from the point of view of adjusting to try and make this thing as small as possible

188
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:43,487
Play Slugs at adjust a constant it doesn't have any Q dependents so

189
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,791
We don't know this but it doesn't matter

190
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,119
In fact

191
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:55,519
Love I need is it not mess up but maybe by minimizing this thing we might be able to find out what it is

192
00:11:56,287 --> 00:12:02,431
I'm finally this thing isn't I'll agreeing it's the entropy of a distribution q that we can control on weekends

193
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:06,015
Who is allowed to have the following form only

194
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:09,343
I maybe we can constrain Q so that we can about the right this

195
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,879
So for the green cake tonight

196
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:14,975
So this objective function out all of the two I've listed

197
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:18,047
It's promising maybe we can evaluate it

198
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:23,423
And if we rearrange it's on the board

199
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,775
And focus on the two tons of ticks

200
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,567
So this one here

201
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,127
And this one here

202
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:41,087
We can define an objective function that's made up of those two and that's what I put on the computer screen

203
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,623
Variation free energy

204
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,927
It depends on the adjustable parameters

205
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:51,071
Do and it by definition is the average of

206
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:54,399
The interesting energy function on the Keurig

207
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,703
Minus

208
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,495
Sub-Q locator

209
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:03,359
The entropy

210
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:08,479
All cute and the fisa defendants in hair is

211
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,807
This distribution Q

212
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,391
Depends on Peter Peter is a description of

213
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,671
How are you justice

214
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:22,303
Right on this thing has a name it's called variational free energy

215
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,775
And because of where this came from

216
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,335
And because of the fact that this thing here

217
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,639
Is

218
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,175
Positive

219
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:41,503
It is a true statement.

220
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,807
Astalavista

221
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,647
Is love a bounded by

222
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:50,207
- log Zed

223
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:58,655
So if we succeed in minimizing the variational free energy we will have also minimized

224
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:05,311
The KL between q and P and the objective function that pops out of that minimisation if we can evaluate the variational friends

225
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:11,455
Is abound unlock said so will for free be getting something interesting

226
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,223
Out

227
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,015
Okay

228
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:19,135
So the variational method to talk to you about today

229
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:25,535
Are entirely based on this objective functions there are other variation methods as well but that's all I'm going to say

230
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,559
Do today

231
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:33,727
So let's look at some examples now so you can see how this works

232
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,799
Can we evaluate its variation free energy

233
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:41,151
Well for some problems for some red energy

234
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:47,295
The answer is yes you can as long as you can straighten cue to have an appropriately simple form

235
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,855
So let's go through two examples

236
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:58,559
The first example dude is the good old gaussian distribution

237
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,863
Inference aveiro

238
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:09,055
So hopefully you remember this distribution

239
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,335
End

240
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:13,151
All discussions of inference problem

241
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:30,815
So the assumption is that there's a normal distribution with parameters muessigmann Squad

242
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:34,399
Indata X

243
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:44,127
We don't want to infer new and sigma

244
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:48,223
So the red distribution

245
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:53,343
Is the inference of

246
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:56,159
And the variance

247
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,975
And we look at that before

248
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:05,119
And if this is the new actress and if this is the sigma

249
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,655
Square taxes

250
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:10,239
What the nasty read distribution looks like

251
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,823
It's something right like that

252
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:19,199
A distribution that has the property that any slice through it in this direction

253
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,015
Is a normal distribution

254
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,695
Sorry I didn't realize very well

255
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:37,119
And all of those I'll send it on the same place in spite of what it looks like the rules sent it on Xbox

256
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,655
Sample me

257
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,191
So

258
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,519
My sweetheart

259
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:59,135
Okay so we'll three slices through normal distributions

260
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:05,535
I'm slices in this direction are gamma distributions

261
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,935
The

262
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,495
Maximum of the posterior

263
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:19,615
Under the assumptions that we had earlier in the course

264
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,431
Is out of place called

265
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,503
Sigma is

266
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:29,087
SEPTA Sigma an Instagram button on your calculator

267
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:33,695
However if we marginalized over all of these gamma distribution

268
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:36,511
The projection of all of those onto

269
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:37,791
The taxes

270
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,375
Is a gamma distribution

271
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,655
That has a peak

272
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:46,239
Larger value of Sigma

273
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:49,311
Cold like my last one

274
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:53,663
Okay so this is a very simple distribution

275
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,199
And

276
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,247
We're going to Pretend We're

277
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:03,647
Challenge Enough by it that we want the variational method so what we will not do is introduce

278
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,695
Severe reaction approximation

279
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,975
Where the

280
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:13,119
In fruits which is a partner Distribution on the UNC glad Haven today

281
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:17,215
It's going to be approximated by a similar distribution to

282
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:21,823
How much we want to constrain it what form so we can spray it have

283
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:28,479
Well I'm going to constrain it very little indeed I'm just going to constrain it to be

284
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:34,879
Separable distribution a function of Mew a function

285
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,439
About the constraints apply

286
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:42,303
And then we can ask the question now if we write down a little

287
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,863
I minimize it what happens

288
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,055
Suck his what happens

289
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:12,255
We have temporarily lost on display

290
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:20,191
So that's the red distribution that's an accurate account Roblox I love it

291
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:20,959
And

292
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:26,335
If you don't kick off with any distribution to of this separable form

293
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:31,199
And then you say let's alternately update

294
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,735
Bermuda pendant

295
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,759
Function

296
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,807
And then the sigma dependent function

297
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:42,207
Ultimately update them and see what happens the answer is straight away when you optimize the music

298
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:46,047
Kind of warm the new dependent thing says I want to be a gaussian please

299
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,095
And

300
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:55,007
So you can do that and then if you update the sigma dependent one it'll say I want to be a gamma distribution

301
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:55,775
Place

302
00:19:56,287 --> 00:20:02,431
Americans Aspen you depending on what you want to do now and it says of course I want to be a gas yet but he will

303
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,711
Changes Prime

304
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:08,063
And then you ask what you want to do so we can do this.

305
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:13,183
Alternating update approach to the optimization of that what I'm doing is

306
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,463
Optimizing

307
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:20,863
Acquittal the variation free energy with respect to the distribution and then with aesthetically Sigma and then

308
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,655
Ultimatum this right

309
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,703
And when you run that to convergence

310
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:26,239
You end up with

311
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:29,055
Optimize Q distribution that isn't normal

312
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:32,383
And an uprising a distribution that is a gamma

313
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,991
Optimized distribution

314
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:43,135
Open Mew isn't normal distribution send it on Xbox of course what else could it possibly be

315
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:49,023
But it went isn't the same as this slice through hair it's a bit faster

316
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:53,375
Optimize distribution for Sigma

317
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:58,239
Doesn't have its maximum that cigarette it's a cigarette

318
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,311
So this is the case where are we

319
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:07,711
Constrain the distribution to be wrong in a fairly simple way making it separable is a fairly standard

320
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:11,807
And then you end up with built-in ice distribution

321
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:15,391
Having DeSoto properties. We kind of want

322
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:22,048
It's not the case if you marginalize out knew that you got the correct posterior the true posterior

323
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:26,912
Mu student distribution is a mixture of all of those calcium soap

324
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:29,216
We haven't magically

325
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:35,616
Go around the fundamental problem the truth is it is a slightly nasty mixture of gases

326
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,432
Nevertheless

327
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:44,832
It's got the right sort of properties so if you ask what what's it mean what's its characteristic with

328
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,880
It's got the right contrast it with

329
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:51,744
Okay so that was example number one any questions about

330
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,768
But let

331
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:04,032
Example number two is the spin system which we've discussed on and off

332
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,312
In the past

333
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,104
So

334
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,408
Aspen system has couplings

335
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:14,272
J between the spins which a binary variables

336
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,064
Find

337
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:21,696
Open systems display all sorts of exciting properties

338
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:31,936
7sd red distribution

339
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,752
Is

00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:39,360
Activate reminders

341
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:42,688
Reset science and energy

342
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:45,248
Naan bread

343
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:48,832
Notice the addition because we doing physics

344
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:52,672
All the temperature promise I will a coldness brown with a betta

345
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:55,232
Which multiplies the energy upstairs

346
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,024
And

347
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,840
It makes the Zedge Visa dependents

348
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:02,656
The way the free energy response to that

349
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,448
Is we shoving

350
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:08,288
Ibiza hair

351
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:11,104
And then the free energy depends both on theater

352
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,896
And pizza

353
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,504
Okay and then the free energy is always abandoned on

354
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:23,904
Zelda Peterson I can pick any betta and do the virtual free energy minimization for that

355
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,928
Particular problem

356
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:26,720
Okay

357
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:33,376
And the spring system is energy of X is mine

358
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:37,472

362
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:48,992
And then the maybe local Fields applying for each of the things

363
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:52,064
Libras and The Exodus live in

364
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:55,648
-1 + 1

365
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:59,488
The power and so the ex lives on the corners of a

366
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,512
Hypercube

367
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:06,656
And the reason this is a nasty problem is because of this system had the fact that

368
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:11,776
That all couplings between pass pints is what makes it a nasty red thing

369
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:18,432
If only it were the case that we didn't have these coupling tons then it would be a simple distribution

370
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:24,832
Dinasty this just says the energy is a sum of x one free Spin and that means when you

371
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:28,416
How to be independent from each other if we only had this time

372
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:32,256
Play wouldn't it be nice if the distribution look like that

373
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:36,864
Not much like saying well let's go ahead and declare our proximation distribution

374
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,936
Doobie simple let's declare it have the form

375
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:46,336
Cube root of x is a normalized version of Eataly

376
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:48,640
Come over and a and

377
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,944
Xn

378
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:59,392
So now in this approximation distribution each of the spins has just got its own personal applied field that favors

379
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,928
Being up or down depending on me

380
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,720
Sign of a n

381
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:06,048
So this is a distribution and very easy to work with

382
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:12,704
Just emphasize that is separable I can write this is a product from 1 to end all of an individual

383
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,776
Distribution for the nth spin alone

384
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:24,480
Just like a moment ago we said let's pretend the distribution of mu and sigma squared

385
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:26,784
Get support to make it by separable

386
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,320
A product of distributions

387
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:32,160
So the parameters in this case all these ANS this is

388
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:36,000
The thing I was generally calling feature is the set of all of these

389
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:37,280
Hey ants

390
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:45,472
And just write this one of the weight

391
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:51,872
This is Ethan Ethan

392
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:58,016
Suck because it's a separable distribution it's easy to evaluate its entropy

393
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:00,320
And it's not

394
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:02,368
AAA office but we can

395
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:07,488
Easily evaluate the expected value of the energy even though the energy couplings in it

396
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,304
Let's go to the screen now to

397
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,584
Talk through this

398
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,960
The screen shows the approximate distribution in green on the second equation

399
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:24,128
What's that equation right side Beach astrallana colors old green and red so we can keep track of what what

400
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,152
And you see

401
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:31,040
We're going to simple entropy that's just the enthalpy of acceptable distribution so that right-hand green time is easy

402
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:34,368
Barely nastiness comes in the from the Reds terms

403
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:37,696
Why we look at the average value of the couplings

404
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,512
Under the distribution Q

405
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:42,304
So we not go down

406
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:46,400
To the next equation in parentheses who got the expected value of the energy

407
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,192
And

408
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,520
To get the coupling

409
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:57,408
Tums contribution we just need to know that some over Willamette Dental of jmn times

410
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:59,456
The average value of x Bar M

411
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:01,504
Average value of x Bar n

412
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,552
Because two is separable

413
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:04,832
That

414
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:07,136
Simpleset is true

415
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:12,768
So now all you need to know to evaluate the energy is well what's the mean value if each of the spins

416
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,048
On the Q

417
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:15,584
Right

418
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,608
American

419
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:23,008
Pop-up all of your ends grad contributions reach of it

420
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,360
So we can evaluate the variational free energy

421
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:34,016
And when you look at this and you say how do I adjust it with respect to fisa remember these are here is the second

422
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,064
Biases a

423
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,600
For the individual spins

424
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:44,256
And what effect do those have will they change what the probability of a spin being up

425
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:49,120
Which changes the mean value of that Spencer Q in hair

426
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:55,520
Is my name for the probability of one of those things being up the end spending up and X bar and

427
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:57,312
Is the mean value of the spin

428
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:00,128
They are truly related to each other

429
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:02,688
Strong and rough

430
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,736
So

431
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:09,856
Is

432
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:12,416
Cure for being a mistake plus one

433
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:15,232
His cue for being in the State minus 1

434
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:17,536
And

435
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,072
X

436
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:24,192
Is just the sum of Q + 1

437
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:29,056
+ -1 * 3 - 1

438
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:33,152
So xbar is linearly related to

439
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:33,920
The Q

440
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,064
Florida gun packing right pieces

441
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:42,112
Minus

442
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:46,208
Which is

443
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,768
Too cute

444
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,048
French

445
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,240
Okay

446
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:05,664
So the adjustable promises are a 4q or Xbox

447
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:12,064
Ways of describing what we're going to do just if you minimize with respect to that set of an adjustable thing

448
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,880
The end degrees of freedom The Cure

449
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:21,280
You find that the optimum satisfies these two equations which you can again sold by its rating them

450
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,328
The first equation says

451
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:29,728
That you can work out a by looking at all the main states of your neighbors so if you are the

452
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,264
Spin

453
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,544
You going to look

454
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:39,968
All your neighbors stations I want to assure you you talk a lot and that tells you what you

455
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,248
Will a should be

456
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:46,880
And then your a is related to your Xbox through Xbox stench of a

457
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:53,536
Yet another relationship I could have written down as of this time

458
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:58,912
Ham comes from having an Easter + 1 + 8 + -1

459
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,960
Consciousness comes from

460
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:03,008
Okay

461
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:10,688
So I didn't want to Labour through the derivation of this on on the board it's all in the book if you want to

462
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:13,248
Look at it will Catholic

463
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,040
What Gabriel message

464
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:21,184
We can take a recently Nestea distribution that has properties

465
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,744
We can approximated by separable distribution

466
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,608
Then we can minimize the variation free energy update equations look like this

467
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,448
Your local average field

468
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:38,848
From your neighbors and set yourself into a state that spits out your your average response to that

469
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:39,872
Applied trailer

470
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:43,456
When you got oil spins to do that

471
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:45,248
And

472
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:52,160
If you it's right those equations you got to a minimum of the reaction free energy let's do this no

473
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:54,720
An example of a tooth pain

474
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:55,744
System

475
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,816
So on the board I'll just talk through

476
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,376
I was to spend systemworks

477
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:23,648
Okay

478
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,976
So here is the incredibly nasty distribution

479
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:31,328
The spin system has two spins X1 and X2

480
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:34,912
I need two of them is a mistake + -1

481
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,544
The energy is minus

482
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,312
X1

483
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:43,360
X x x

484
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:44,384
All right

485
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:45,664
That's it

486
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:52,832
The connection to what we've just been doing is it's the spin system with just two spins x y and x 2

487
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:57,696
I know a couple with a coupling of strength J that is equal to 1

488
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:01,024
Prince princesses don't get much simpler than this

489
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:05,376
Sobe variational free energy

490
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:13,568
Repeating the derivation we're just being through so that General pay civilians men's is Vita X

491
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:16,896
X1 X2

492
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:23,296
- 151 - Santa Fe

493
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:25,856
To Tunisia entropies base

494
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:29,952
Okay

495
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:37,632
What's the equation what does this actually look like let's just drawer it's a space with X1 being - 1

496
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:39,680
Next to being

497
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:45,824
- 101 the real distribution assuming J is positive

498
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:52,992
Favors them both being in the same state with each other so the real distribution red

499
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:54,272
Has

500
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:56,320
Maybe a bit more mass

501
00:32:57,088 --> 00:33:00,928
+ 1 + 1 + -1 - 1

502
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:05,536
On the elf Agonist that's the real distribution is nasty and complicated

503
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,328
Umbrella

504
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,168
Coping with this terrible complexity of this nasty thing

505
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:17,568
Which athlete in treats just requires two numbers to describe it how much must have and how much is that

506
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:23,968
Approximation distribution by green thing and the green thing says oh I want to separate

507
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:28,576
Approximation please song going to have a Q Wang

508
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:30,624
That puts a mask on

509
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:35,744
SMS on maybe a few to the put some nice on here

510
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,816
I'm here I'm just too adjustable promises which is

511
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:42,656
What's the bias of q1 and Q2

512
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:59,040
And if you multiply together Accu distribution. For example could put more weight on plus one

513
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,576
But each of them

514
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:06,720
Came up by those two with by each other then the Q distribution you'll end up with will put most of its mass on this corner

515
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:10,816
A very small amount on this corner and a middling amount on this one

516
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,144
You with me

517
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:20,032
And with free to wander around in to Wong

518
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:22,592
Cuties face

519
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:26,688
Wacky Wong is say the value of this thing

520
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:33,088
How much mass is getting on + 1/2 + Q2 is how much mass does the Second Spin

521
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:35,136
It's being in the first one

522
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:40,256
And as we wander around in q1 and Q2 weekend flaws

523
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:43,328
The variation of free energy

524
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,120
And I will now

525
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,912
Do that for you

526
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,568
And I'm doing this as we bury betta so

527
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,104
The sequence of plots

528
00:34:57,408 --> 00:35:00,736
Starting with b to very small which means high temperature

529
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:05,856
I'm going to Lodge between is very cold temperatures

530
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:10,976
Dog got to a vehicle temperature betta is now to

531
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:14,816
And you can see what the free energy looks like and the answer is

532
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:16,608
That it's got

533
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,144
Two Minima

534
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:24,544
These two axes are q1 Q2 I'm going exactly the same function twice over but different views into the clinic

535
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,920
Monkeys with the Contours projected onto the base on the right hand side

536
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,968
So hopefully can see what's going off

537
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:34,784
Suck

538
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,320
What's happening

539
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,416
Jaivita which means

540
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:43,744
High coldness or low temperature

541
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,984
The free energy

542
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,544
Adult Minnie Mouse

543
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,824
Hair

544
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,848
Pentair

545
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:03,200
So that's when the teacher is to

546
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:07,296
At The Other Extreme

547
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,600
Let's go back again

548
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:11,392
Lights on please

549
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:18,560
I'm halfway here and I'll grab it further

550
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:26,752
Cut his the high temperature and the things so they can beat it down to four

551
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,544
I receive that

552
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:31,616
The minimum of Today Show free energy

553
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:33,920
Its hair

554
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,224
All right

555
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,064
And as we go between those two extremes

556
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:46,208
SeaTac going from Mill Point Pool

557
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:50,048
Optive to there's a place where a transition

558
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:52,864
Happens in

559
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,888
Looks like

560
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,496
Ready 3 2 1

561
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,824
Well that's aggravate Contour Abyss

562
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:04,640
Alright one more time

563
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:08,480
Don't say it again

564
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:15,136
Sorry start with a single minimum and then beats are equals one the Figure 8

565
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,160
We have to minimize

566
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:19,488
All right coming back down

567
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,840
As a figure of 8 and it vanishes Vera Beecher equals 1

568
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:25,376
Okay

569
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:31,776
So if I summarize where the minima by showing the value of both

570
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:33,568
Q1 and Q2

571
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:40,224
On this access and I'll put a star on it

572
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,248
At 3

573
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,784
High temperature

574
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,320
The optimum

575
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:45,856
Is

576
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:47,904
At

577
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,000
Do you want Auntie to both equal to 1/2

578
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:58,912
And then the transition happens when Beach was one

579
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,704
I got his pop

580
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:08,384
And then we have something like this have a choice you can go either way to the top or the bottom left

581
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:09,408
Minimum

582
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,320
What do you think of that

583
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:21,184
Some people

584
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:25,536
Get distracted by the concept of

585
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:27,072
Chinese transitions

586
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:33,728
And whenever they see a bifurcation a transition from Vallejo

587
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,264
And I think that's a

588
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,848
Mistaken way of responding to the world

589
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:44,736
The truth is we're trying to approximate this red distribution as we change the temperature

590
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:47,808
Between very high temperatures

591
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:55,744
At high temperatures the distribution looks like this and you can hardly see

592
00:38:56,768 --> 00:39:00,864
That these two guys have a little bit

593
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:04,192
And a very low temperatures

594
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:07,008
You end up with a well that looks like this

595
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:12,640
With all the masks on the diagonal and vertical

596
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,432
I thought you go

597
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:19,808
Through different bodies of Beka from this world of high temperature today supposed low temperature

598
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:26,464
The true red system doesn't have a phase transition it just its distribution just changes from being missed

599
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,768
Is completely continuous

600
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,096
And the fact that this approximation that we've introduced

601
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:34,912
Has a transition it has a bifurcation

602
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:41,568
Shouldn't I think vehicles for excitement is I always not wonderful that it's not a phase transition is no

603
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:43,872
Bifurcation

604
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:48,736
And it happens to happen at a temperature of wall which might look a bit like this

605
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:51,040
What is a transition

606
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:52,832
From

607
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:59,744
Insisting on the approximation distributions it look a bit like this by saying while I'm just going to buy a uniform

608
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:07,936
And then once you get above that point then it goes but it says I'm going to approximation distribution that looks rather like this

609
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:13,824
By that distribution that puts almost over Macon hair and little bit on hair little bit on hair

610
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,360
I'm almost nothing at all

611
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:24,320
So I feel fairly sanguine about whether this is a useful approximation or not it's mathematically

612
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:29,696
Nice and it's good to be familiar with it because it's something crops up a lot

613
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:36,608
But I'd like to emphasise but real system and read it doesn't have a phase transition and this transition that the green system has

614
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:38,144
Compass point hair

615
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,472
Yes it's a bifurcation

616
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:51,200
But it's not a phase transition a phase transition is a much more interesting phenomenon where the various

617
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:56,320
The energy diverges and all sorts of exciting phenomena occur

618
00:40:58,112 --> 00:41:01,696
Now we could go through another example which is

619
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:06,048
This pain system with a coupling between lots of Neighbors

620
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:09,376
And if a couple and girl identical

621
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:16,288
If they're all equal to say plus one between Aspen and its neighbors and it has been said the same number of Neighbors

622
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:19,360
Then actually reaches down the entire calculation hair

623
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:25,760
It comes out exactly the same there any change would be if you've got to neighbors then you put a 2in hair if you don't fool Neighbors

624
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:32,160
The factory floor in half of this whole calculation we're just going through that we're just telling you what

625
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:34,976
What will happen first system with n spins as well

626
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:43,936
I'm missing that just emphasize it the real in the real world

627
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:49,056
Welchol available in the world of systems with lots and lots of things were then spins

628
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:55,455
Wet and is very large you can get phase Transitions and the ising model for example is a cyst

629
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:58,015
Where are you couple to go full Neighbors

630
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:01,855
And the icing mobile as we saw the last time does have a phase transition

631
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:11,839
This is what happens when you use the variational method to approximate it I just emphasized the what has happened was not

632
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:18,239
And it didn't happen because the underlying system had a face from the very should be very skeptical about people who say oh look at my

633
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:24,127
Variational method applied to the ice T-Mobile and look at how the phase transition because it hasn't

634
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,919
Okay

635
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:31,295
Why am I saying a list well I think there's a

636
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:34,367
This Methodist variational method

637
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:41,023
It's quite widely used to name and this is a question for a physicist

638
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:47,423
In the audience in these equations before

639
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:51,519
Down again the equations that I drive for the general spin system

640
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:57,919
And what we've gone through here is a special case where all the days are equal to a single number

641
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:02,783
Have you seen these equations before and what was it called yes

642
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:10,463
It's cold mean field Theory with all the mean field approximation

643
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:17,631
And often when it's derived people I'm not clear on the derivation it's just well let's do this

644
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:24,031
Take the mean of this if your luck it may be well explain but

645
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:26,591
The first time I encountered mean field Theory

646
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:32,991
It just seemed like a a sequence of arbitrary

647
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:34,527
Approximation

648
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:40,927
It also goes by various other names at sometime Schuylkill device Theory at least in the Cambridge

649
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:42,463
Thermodynamics course

650
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:49,119
And occasionally you may have people calling about talk about the fireman trick Caswell

651
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:52,959
All the fun run

652
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:55,519
Approximation

653
00:43:56,799 --> 00:44:01,919
So these are all names for the same thing and what I've shown your hair is

654
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:04,479
Derivation of mean field Theory

655
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:07,295
By writing down a variational free energy

656
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:10,367
And then minimizing it

657
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:16,767
I like this way of deriving mean field Theory because it's very clear what the objective function is it clear what you're doing

658
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:22,655
And it don't motivate other generalizations so just to finish this little 7

659
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:26,239
Why do I like

660
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:35,711
The variational free energy review

661
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:39,807
All Mint Hill Perry

662
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:43,135
I love it

663
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:49,279
Because it's going to clear objective function from which you can derive

664
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:52,095
The equations

665
00:44:56,959 --> 00:45:03,103
So that's nice cuz maybe you need to memorize less you just memorize objective function and everything can be

666
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:09,247
It is generalizable you could in principle shoes

667
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:14,879
More complex approximating distributions cute

668
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:17,695
And then you could

669
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:19,231
Generalize your

670
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:23,071
Flash on message

671
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:27,167
As long as you can evaluate and optimize

672
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,191
Petrol

673
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:35,615
And the third reason for loving this beauty is it shows that when you do mean field Theory you are actually getting a biome

674
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:36,639
On that

675
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:41,503
That shows that these mean field methods

676
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,855
Give

677
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,135
Abound

678
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:51,487
I'm glad which is an interesting thing to be able to compute

679
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:56,095
Okay that's

680
00:45:57,887 --> 00:46:00,191
Mean field Theory not variational methods

681
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:04,287
And that is the end of the lecture

682
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:10,175
My plan is the next lecture will be an introduction to neural networks

683
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:12,991
And then

684
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:19,391
Will probably spend to lectures on neural networks and maybe the second lecture also wrap up for a little discussion of State

685
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:21,439
Erich fend coats

686
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:23,487
All there any questions on

687
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:24,511
Dyslexia

688
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:29,119
Okay thanks so much

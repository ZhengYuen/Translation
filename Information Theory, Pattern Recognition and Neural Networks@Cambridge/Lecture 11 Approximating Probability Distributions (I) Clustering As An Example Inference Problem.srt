Information Theory

4
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:19,456
I'm interested in a moment different ways of doing

5
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:20,736
Modeling

6
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:28,672
I want to remind you where the website is on the website

7
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:29,440
Free

8
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:34,304
I'm just to tell you a little bit about

9
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:40,448
In the next stop talking about multicolor method is a little

10
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:45,056
Encyclopedia of interesting multicolor matters. We will go through

11
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:50,688

Motivation interested in Calabasas

14
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,184
About

15
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,024
As an example of an inference

16
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,424
I'll give all the motivations about you have to have electron clustering

17
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,312
I just gave you an abstract concept

18
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:25,504
Problem

19
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,528
Reset

20
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:33,952
I want to know what the exponential

21
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:42,656
Asian cockroach

22
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:49,056

27
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:07,744
I'm over all the parts to the two

28
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:10,048
Credentials

29
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:17,216
Made a slip last time I mentioned that I did I have to change the rules

30
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,664
At the window

31
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,224
Freret Street

32
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,792
So now we're about to discuss clustering our kickoff with a little exercise which is

33
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:45,120
Information theory noisy Channel

34
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,400
Question

35
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,728
And it goes like this channel

36
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:53,312
Who won

37
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,408
And then what channel is a real number y

38
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:02,272
Why is Cassian around 1

39
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,552
Call me to

40
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,576
Depending

41
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:07,904
Channel

42
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:16,096
If you want to know about the capacity of the channel

43
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,376
Which is

44
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,168
You use this channel

45
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:26,336
The prior probabilities of the two possible values of a

46
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,128
Charlie's used once

47
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,664
Why

48
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,992
What is the posterior probability

49
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,832
Please

50
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:40,416
Look up

51
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:47,840
As a function of Y I'd like it in the form of a woman

53
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,784
Okay

54
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:10,624
We're right on Bayes Theorem

56
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:19,071
Why is

57
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:24,191
Like a Mac

58
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:26,751
Volume is on my rule

59
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:30,335
Possible values

60
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:48,255
When you rearrange that into 1/4 -

61
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,583
Where is my name for

62
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:57,471
Damn why

63
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:04,127

One of the âˆš 2 pi Sigma squaresville cancel out sodium

68
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,895
Where is it be interesting

69
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,431
Why didn't the fish

70
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:43,295
And if you want to be elegant you can remember

71
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,231
I like that you

72
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,303
Elegant way of writing this

73
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,175
Hey

74
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:14,527
As a function of Y

75
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,575
Is something linear function

76
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:21,951
Like this

77
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:30,399
M1 and M2

78
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,983
Why

79
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,055
Find a is a measure of

00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:48,063
Winit

81
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,183
Remind me to

82
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:00,351
Probability that X is long why

83
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,143
Look something like this

84
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:14,943
Straight line

85
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:21,087
This is the place where the two products

86
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:27,487
Prosthetic little bit 75050 is here

87
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:37,215
Applied

88
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:44,639
Send it

Life estate

90
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:57,183
Okay any questions

91
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,719
Rabbit

92
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:05,375
So if I tell you I'm going to use this channel then the output of the channel

93
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:12,031
Why is a real number whose probability distribution is a mixture

94
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,079
Jesse Owens

95
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:23,551
Guy looks like it might look like

96
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:41,471
So why do you care about me so well

97
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:46,335
We might be

98
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,871
Grecian

99
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,175
You might be interested

101
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:10,399
Play with now I'm going to show you some

102
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:14,495
And we'll see how that

103
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:18,335
Inferences to do with me

104
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:26,527
So it's a real data just to remind you what we might actually talk about if you're doing real clustering

105
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:32,415
Frequency of speech

106
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:41,119

00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:59,295
Rent A Streetcar the picture and then you want to recognize which get you guys

109
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:05,695
Which babies do in the language

110
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:11,071
Listening to these references coming out

111
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:15,935
I made it over and over

112
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:21,567
K means clustering

113
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,175
Hey

114
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:32,575
The number the number please

115
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,951
Differentiation

116
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,143
So let me show you

117
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,935
Hangman solver

118
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,855
Where is resume

119
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,207
Awesome date real values

120
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:22,495
As an example maybe when making an automatic vegetable sourcing

121
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:30,943
I'm not going to use text Walnut x-23

122
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,479
Real numbers

123
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,527
Change notation

124
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:41,439
So what we measure is X1 and X2 and maybe a whole bunch of other

125
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:48,095
These are measurements made by our automated vegetable measuring machinery

126
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:51,679
Maybe X1 is reflections

127
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:55,519
609

128
00:11:55,775 --> 00:12:01,919

So his house memes

130
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:34,943
We take all the data we've seen so far

135
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:03,615
How many police means I mean to initially

136
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,431
You just let me down anyway you like

139
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:25,887
Hey hey

140
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,191
Brenda

141
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,567
At step one

142
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,639
Step to it

143
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:42,527
We assign each of these datapoints

144
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,439
The nearest

145
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:57,887
Is

146
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,239
Find a distance to measures how close you are

147
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:07,615
Distance here is going to be

148
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:20,927
MK - x at

149
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:26,559
Not the distance

150
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:30,399
Young ball

151
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,287
So

152
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,639
We assign each point to the nearest

153
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:52,159
Ridiculous

154
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,767

Call Lisa Lisa closest to

156
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:16,735
Another way of saying what happens when you sign them is we could introduce

157
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:19,807
Thinkful responsibility

158
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:27,231
Define how responsible he chased me is for the endpoint

159
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,023
By saying

160
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:35,423
Well it's on its places to me that I'm responsible for it I have walked

161
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:43,615
I'm just giving you a new piece of notation

162
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,895
Responsibility

163
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:51,295
Guam if NK is the closest

164
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,879
2

165
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,439
Extant

166
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,791
Otherwise

167
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,631
Another way

168
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,503
Responsibility is wrong

169
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:32,767
Hey minimizes with respects

170
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:47,359
All right

171
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:51,199
Let's go ahead and do this on the screen with an example

172
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,479
I'll grab some beta

173
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,783
Disappoint turning green

174
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:07,071
And now we slap in Maine have an issue we were all clapping to

175
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:10,911
Random Orange

176
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,191
Green

177
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:15,775
Navigate to say who you closest to

178
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:22,431
Culinary tastes like oranges

179
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,991
Agreed

180
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,807
Step 3

181
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:33,439
Update to me updates that works like this

182
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:36,767
The me number one

183
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,583
The meaning of the datapoint

184
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,191
Guam

185
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,727
Omca in general

186
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,799
That sets to the sum

187
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:59,295
Divided by the number of points that you can write that responsibility

188
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,975
Famous coming over

189
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,535
The end

190
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:19,007
Don't you mean

191
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,687
So like that again

192
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:29,503
And let's do it so we update

193
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,783
Tumi

194
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,391
In orange green to be the me

195
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:41,535
And then we repeat so you go back

198
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,519
What do you do again

199
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,055
Is it sunset

200
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,663
Update to me

201
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,503

Reassign

203
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,599

Update

215
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:59,871
I'm not sure if you could do whatever you want and something happens

216
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,431

217
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,735

Grey orange

231
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:41,599
Boundary of that

232
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:48,255
Something you may be starting to feel already as I'm not sure like I mean

233
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:51,071
Assign

234
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,407
Call me

235
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:09,247
Another one

236
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:16,672
Lost messages coming through that you can run pay me to find some trusses for you it will give you a stable and say

237
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:20,000
The insider time call random initialisation

238
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:26,400
I may be some insight

239
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,216
I take

240
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:37,408
Let's take it that I'm seeing if you can makeup

241
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:43,552
Like scabies even less than we do at low-hanging is already quite

242
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:47,136
A widely used algorithm

243
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:54,048
So let's pick some different salads

244
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,400
Dataon made

245
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:02,496
Which if you ask a human they might say yes

246
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:06,336
They said haha we have a clustering algorithm

247
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:12,480
Talk to me at random

248
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,648
Like what we had in mind right

249
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:26,560
You mean

250
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:32,192
Green guys going grabbed a few guys if you really want

251
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:41,920
Really doing what

252
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:48,320
Try one more time

253
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:55,232
Okay that's not quite idealism

254
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:00,096
We can always try using bull

255
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:06,752
Me at all at 7 instead

256
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,592
This how I got wonderful

257
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,200
I don't know. Maybe the road is that

258
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:24,160
I still don't answer yellow cluster

259
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:31,328
Chinese food

260
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:36,192
I have to be

261
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:41,824
What should we look at next let's switch stages at one more time

262
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,688
And I'll show you

263
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,992
This song

264
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:58,208
So ask human how many classes are there in this time

265
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:14,336
Okay

266
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,640
Find

267
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:18,688
Update

268
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,808
Sign up date for sign up date

269
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,368
Beautiful

270
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:28,160
It's time.

271
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:35,328
Okay to do it again

272
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,424
Bygone

273
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,104
Okay

274
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:53,504
So it's not a million miles

275
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,576
Improve it

276
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:03,232
What if you normalize Checotah okay

277
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:06,304
What is normal life according to me

278
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:11,680
Take me to a certain before you get it to the stupid algorithm

279
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:13,984
All right

280
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:16,288
Imagine doing that

281
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:26,272
Play something relaxing

282
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:27,808
Instead of

283
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:34,464
Flying with you and giving you your normal eyesight today just at the one that looks like

284
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,512
Okay

285
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,680
Still got it right

286
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:46,496
Maybe not quite as badly as this one

287
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:52,896
Let's not let's have a different

288
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,456
Tree tree modify the algorithm

289
00:25:55,712 --> 00:26:01,856
Let's give it an interpretation because actually it's too perfect

290
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,672
Hallowell Define probabilistic

291
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:08,000
Mainly if you think of this

292
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:10,048
Distance

293
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:15,168
The thing that is in the Easton lineup

294
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:22,592
Misting hat

295
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,688
What is algorithm

296
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:28,480
Is it corresponds to

297
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:32,064
Assuming that the data comes from

298
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:35,648
A mixture of pee costumes

299
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:42,304
They all have the same

300
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:48,448
Call with the same

301
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,008
Variance

302
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,312
Not the same in all directions

303
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:59,968
Historical

304
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,416
And then

305
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:14,816
The final assumption is it they all have the same privacy I want equal to

306
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:18,144
Hi hey

307
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,496
And then the algorithm we're running here is a a

308
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:25,568
Greedy algorithm that is

309
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:35,040
Define precisely what it's doing it's coming up with

310
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,904
The points

311
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:46,816
It's been doing Elvis thing with me which is finding us or mocha

312
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,120
Maximum

313
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:52,448
All right

314
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:58,592
Is roughly

315
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:04,224
Map maximum a posteriori

316
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:06,784
Algorithm

317
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,488
The

318
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,536
Science variables

319
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:21,632
Wish we could call Cayenne

320
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:27,520
Which pasta

321
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:36,224
So as to maximize

322
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,440
Call C

323
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,000
Science

324
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:52,096
Sebastian interpretational

325
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,424
Interpretation

326
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:58,240
I guess we can say

327
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:03,616
Oh my God

328
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:09,504
It will be tonight

329
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:14,624
I'm maybe we can also how many change these assumptions had one two three

330
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:21,280
Maybe we can change its algorithm if you want to know the most probable

331
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:26,144
Credible

332
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:30,752
Cuz even if

333
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:36,640
I really do come to identical Gaskins

334
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:39,968
Eco crossover

335
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:45,344
Try putting memes in the right places

336
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:49,696
I will put my long hair meet you halfway

337
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:51,744
Then put your divider in

338
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:55,584
Allocate all of these guys

339
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:58,912
Prostitute

340
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:01,472
That what happens when you run the updates.

341
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,800
What's the meaning of this shaded law

342
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:08,640
Didn't write license on me to

343
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:14,016
Lost it

344
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,320
Golytely

345
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:22,720
So even in the case where all these assumptions are true the Mac Alberta

346
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,000
Ends up

347
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:28,864
Allocation is ends up in the wrong place

348
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:35,520
It doesn't quite like this because I'm at Izzy

349
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:39,360
Modify the algorithm

350
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:44,224
The Next Step

351
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:46,016
Is School

352
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:51,904
K means algorithm

353
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:58,304
Stop in the same way by initializing a meeting at random

354
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:07,520
Reset a Surface Pro

355
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:11,616
Everybody

356
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,408
Rita's naagin-2

357
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,968
Come and change our assignment group

358
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:20,576
Miss Simon.

359
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:24,160
So we sign lunch

360
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:33,632
Going to say r&k responsibility

361
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,168
Is

362
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,688
So in contrast to setting case the minimum

363
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:52,064
Minimizes men

364
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,112
So we're going to do this

365
00:31:54,368 --> 00:32:00,512
Eat reminder Pizza distance from MK

366
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:05,120
Raja bike price

367
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:12,288
2 - Pizza

368
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:18,432
Rifling through

369
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,504
Possible Hayes

370
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,832
How close do you feel

371
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:36,352
If you feel like you're the closest little means then you'll end up with a woman

372
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:40,704
Central AC 3%

373
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,264
But you would

374
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:48,384
The team10 only if you set pika

375
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,968
Can you reproduce the old

376
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:54,016
Hawkeye mean

377
00:32:54,528 --> 00:33:00,672
The new definition of d

378
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:03,744
Minimizing

379
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,048
Saira doing is

380
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:10,656
Suck meme

381
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:16,544
And you might recognize that this

382
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,808
Yep they roll meme cake

383
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,648
No change

384
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,720
Wait

385
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:36,000
Beach point

386
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:42,144
By how responsible you feel

387
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:49,312
Say what

388
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:56,224
If we do that

389
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:03,392
We have to take advantage of pizza

390
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,976
You promised Pizza in

391
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:16,192
Just tried setting it to all the values

392
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:25,920
Let's get help with these old points that we have to call

393
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:29,504
How many meetings would you like to talk to him

394
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,296
Zaful

395
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:36,160
I can't we pick about you pizza and I'm representing Pizza

396
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:41,024
Find the radius of a circle because one thing you would

397
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,816
Miss Fisher

398
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,096
Is that

399
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:49,984
Cre8 pop.

400
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:52,288
Tasty tasty

401
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:57,920
And imagine putting a / 6

402
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,272
Lisa

403
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:06,112
Moana

404
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,672
Standard deviation

405
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:15,072
Meaning

406
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:21,472
And I'm telling you how big the Beast

407
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:24,544
I'm sorry runs.

408
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,616
Update my fine fine

409
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:33,760
I'm telling you the color if you Simon is very strongly in favor of one me

410
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:37,600
And if it shows a pale blue that means this point is really cool

411
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,680
Sign

412
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:52,960
Update

413
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:53,984
Define

414
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:03,712
It can be a bit like watching paint dry

415
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:12,160
Hey what's up

416
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:15,744
24 memes

417
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:24,192
I hope your pitbulls

418
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:30,848
It's just an algorithm is doing something on yet

419
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:36,736
Try again

420
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:46,720
The same again for that but it didn't have to do that because we didn't have to give it

421
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:55,424
9five glasses

422
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,000
Sintomi

423
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:25,632
Know what I'm going to do is run me out of different values of preacher

424
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:27,680
Call start with B

425
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:31,008
The number to settle down a bit I'll just change Pizza

426
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,544
Small volume

427
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:34,848
Call

428
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:37,152
That means I'm starting take me to

429
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:44,064
Starting a big standard deviation

430
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:50,464
Send me a pic some deviations then gradually reducing the standard deviation every other

431
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:56,096
Change the sun TV

432
00:37:56,352 --> 00:38:02,496
Justin's endogenous to keep on running the algorithm and I'm not going to try anymore

433
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,568
Run itself

434
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:45,248
Cool beans

435
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:56,512
All right

436
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,816
So that was a very large standard deviation

437
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:05,216
And they're all converging on one place that's a nice vacation if you like I only want one

438
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,312
FBI

439
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,152
So now we're Jesus and deviation little bit

440
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,904
Nursing program

441
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,048
Molars

442
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,912
Do that again

443
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:02,304
So that we have some paintings

444
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:06,144
Notation

445
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,960
It's obsession is receiving that

446
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:14,336
Is a mixture of controlling that

447
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,664
Probabilities are all the same still

448
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:23,296
Wait

449
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:30,720
It's nothing that meteor them anymore because we're doing softer signed so we fix this problem

450
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:34,816
Davis auctions

451
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:41,472
It will at lineman I just get a signal right you have the correct value Sigma that it will sign

452
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:46,592
Just the right way

453
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:52,992
And then when you do need update to me black panther place

454
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:57,344
Nice Italy

455
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:06,048
What we can do as we very Sigma brushes long as you can run through

456
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:12,448
Then what

457
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:22,176
Mac algorithm anymore maximizing

458
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:28,576
Roberts maximum marginal

459
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:29,600
Optimizing

460
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,880
With me

461
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:34,464
Assuming that

462
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:42,400
So we making a bit of progress slightly modified the assumptions of course it's still not well

463
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,216
Problems

464
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:46,240
Call

465
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:55,455
Love is

466
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:59,551
Chinese

467
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:02,879
Listen to me

468
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:03,647
Well

469
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:11,839
Garage Elite

470
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:15,167
Change the assumption

471
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:17,215
You want to exchange

472
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:19,775
Mainly we want to believe that

473
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:25,663
Potassium

474
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:33,087
Progress to Chinese

475
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:39,231
Solar lights on again

476
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:43,327
Call Tammy love

477
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:46,655
Doesn't just update to me

478
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:49,727
It also update

479
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,775
Avaricious

480
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:58,175
And going to redefine what distance is so sensible

481
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:01,503
Dependence

482
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:08,159
So I'm going to have a stigma

483
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:15,071
Instead of having a stiffness will have every Quest

484
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:18,143
Sigma k

485
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:22,751
You'll have to reach at least I mention which I haven't even given a name to I

486
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:26,335
I got someone to the number so I mentioned so that again

487
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:29,663
Going to have

488
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:36,063
Sigma variables for each of those dimensions

489
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:40,927
Station Gaskins might look like

490
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:49,631
Alright so we talked to in sickness

491
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:56,031
So the update rule

492
00:43:56,287 --> 00:44:01,919
It's going to say well let's look at the various

493
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,807
Using my me

494
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:14,463
I will do that just on the ice dimension

495
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:35,967
Okay so there's a variance update rule

496
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:41,599
And we just run the same algorithm with the assignment now being the

497
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:47,999
Appropriate modifications

498
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:49,791
Eastbay

499
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:52,095
Linus

500
00:44:55,935 --> 00:45:00,543
Some mobile dimension

501
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:07,967
So that's okay memes version 2

502
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:20,511
Say what we're going to say if you want to Line Tattoo

503
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:24,863
And it eventually I'm going to have the size changing as well so

504
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:33,823
Will initialize the pies to some sort of I don't have a bunch of people Pike a

505
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:43,807
It's always going to be the same except will my Kay's in hat

506
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:51,231
Hide ending algorithm the update rule that you look at how many points

507
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:52,511
Assigned to you

508
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:56,095
So how many am I responsible for

509
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:04,031
You update your way to say you will

510
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:11,711
So let's do that let's do it first

511
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:23,999
You mean

512
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:27,071
You mean

513
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,863
You mean

514
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:41,919
Let's try another day let us fight for me

515
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:44,991
Can you get it for me and it goes and finds

516
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:47,807
7

517
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:01,375
Still bad things can happen

518
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:11,871
Call Virginia. You tell it you want for me it'll find you before me

519
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:18,271
Everything

520
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:22,623
Compare is actually a variational method

521
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:23,647
At 4

522
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:26,719
Fishing EML Griffin

523
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:29,791
Fishing

524
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:33,375
Hey I just like asking

525
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:37,727
Play preschool algorithm

526
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:40,543
So let's change that status

527
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:43,359
Change to Leland Lodge

528
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:52,063
How many memes would you like to

529
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:57,695
2 memes

530
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:17,919
Mr. oranges

531
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:23,807
Flying Taxi

532
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:30,975
You can imagine having dated that there was a good hypothesis explained it

533
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:36,863
Optimization and it might be difficult to find me

534
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:56,063
Fight me

535
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,367
And it comes up with

536
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:08,351
Call

537
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:17,055
It's still a Survivor tree algorithm at least

538
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:20,383
Automatically handle

539
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:27,807
I didn't mention America when the whole screen something went like blue happened in that case

540
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:32,159
Was that one of the datapoint

541
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:35,743
Taken over by a single me

542
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:38,303
Well

543
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:41,375
It's where you can get update rule hat

544
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:45,215
If you feel very responsible

545
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:48,287
Daniel keep on updating the variance

546
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:53,919
What is one punch timer Costco

547
00:49:54,175 --> 00:50:00,319
And you're very close to your date

548
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:06,719
But no one else is

549
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:13,119
Lowe's up and then that's why this week

550
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:16,703
This isn't

551
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:22,335
The end of the story of it can do kind of all things

552
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:34,879
Green thing is wandering off the screen position because of the Titan fight last night

553
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:48,191
Given the DPAC I just described it as possible so long mean

554
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:51,519
Go to 0 lose up with

555
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:55,615
How to instantly

556
00:50:55,871 --> 00:51:00,735
It's surprisingly a reverse algorithm defect

557
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:07,135
Very rarely under the

558
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:21,471
Automatically

559
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:27,871
What does an inclusion in January new discoveries

560
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:34,015
Okay

561
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:35,295
So

562
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:38,623
That's okay mean

563
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:54,751
So your question is in what sense is this an optimization of the question

564
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:57,311
Okay

565
00:51:57,567 --> 00:52:00,639
When return the variational method

566
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:02,943
Then we'll be able to answer

567
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:09,343
Aveda

568
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:15,743
Why should it

569
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:19,583
It does actually

570
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,631
An objective function

571
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:23,935
Variational free energy

572
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:30,335
Function notation

573
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:36,735
Any other questions

574
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:53,119
Okay so the question is wafted a tire is on a ring or some other type of dates of it

575
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:55,679
Well Detroit

576
00:52:57,983 --> 00:53:04,127
Did you say

577
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:10,527
Please cancel that for me well that what you have done and if you use soft Amy the interpretation of

578
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:16,927
Using haggai

579
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:21,535
But don't have the same sickness

580
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:23,839
Weights on each other anymore

581
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:30,495
But that the interpretation of what you're doing and it's not surprising if you give that doesn't look like

582
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:36,895
Something will happen and you might not be very satisfied.

583
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:40,223
Download

584
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:41,503
Call Lynette

585
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:45,087
What will happen with the dates that like this is

586
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:46,623
My cat

587
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:51,999
David seven clusters in my 12th and 7 gas engine

588
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:55,327
You will get an answer which is

589
00:53:55,839 --> 00:54:01,983
Is sometimes the best way of explaining this Asia one of the best way to explain

590
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,287
Call 7 cast

591
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:17,087
Universal

592
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:31,935
Solution is really hot!

593
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:38,335
That's something we could get through this post Maybe

594
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:43,455
Dimensional

595
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:51,903
Right so the question is could you change the metric

596
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:54,975
So here we can use each of the Lions Hall

597
00:54:55,231 --> 00:55:01,375
You think I'm not motivated the algorithm if you like

598
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:07,519
Any distribution you like

599
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:09,823
Starset Evita -

600
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:13,919
Invent your own

601
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:21,599
And then all you're going to need this is a promise right thing with something like IBEW looking around it and

602
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:23,903
Maybe something like a sick my left

603
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:26,719
You can use that as your assignments that

604
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:28,511
Nugget in hair

605
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:31,583
Then you go to need to get for yourself

606
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:36,703
A new update which tells you what to do with your parameters

607
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:42,335
Probably if you change this from being something Quest

608
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:47,455
Then

609
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:51,039
Yes you can

610
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:53,599
What people actually do

611
00:55:54,111 --> 00:56:00,255
I'm not that up-to-date with you during communication

612
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:02,303
I like to use a t distribution

613
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:08,191
Instead of casting

614
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:12,543
And then you need feel like outside

615
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:16,639
Matthias self is a mixture cotton wool having the same day but different

616
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:28,159
If you read the variational interpretation of this whole thing that will give you a spray work and what you

617
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:31,743
And then figure out an hour

618
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:35,583
Optimizer variation free energy adjust the timer

619
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:38,911
Okay

620
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:41,471
In the next

621
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:47,103
Multicolor Matt let's using this and some other problems as motivation to why we want

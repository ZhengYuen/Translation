1
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:08,960
Okay welcome to the lecture 10

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:16,384
When I tank Cambridge and study Physics I have the privilege of being taught by Steve Gall and I asked him

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,784
How to solve this exam question which I suspect he was the examiner for when it was originally set

4
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,576
We've got

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,672
Events with an exponential distribution we don't know Lambda

6
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:33,792
We can only see the events if they happen in a window that goes from one centimeter to 20 cm

7
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:38,656
Look at all the x coordinates of the points we want to infer Lambda

8
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:41,472
I like to start off by asking you what is

9
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:44,544
Before you heard about Bayesian inference

10
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,128
How would you have gone about solving this problem using

11
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:54,528
Classical statistics methods that you got stored during a Physics course or at High School

12
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:57,344
Seat of the pants

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,112
Method

14
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:00,928
So would you like to tell me

15
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:07,584
Approaches you might have used in general or specific approaches you would use to solve this

16
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:08,608
Task

17
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,144
Yeah

18
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:17,824
Gradient descent in what so you're going to maximize or minimize something

19
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,968
So the idea is optimized

20
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:28,832
Something something that you would optimize

21
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:29,856
5%

22
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:42,144
Okay so optimized a measure

23
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,216
All discrepancy

24
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,312
Between

25
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:55,712
Weather

26
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:57,248
Might look like that

27
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,552
And

28
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,600
The probability density

29
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:10,560
But you got if you pick up a particular value

30
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,120
Lambda

31
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,400
Okay

32
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:19,008
So that sounds a reason why do you some data

33
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:24,896
You have some summary of a data and then you adjust your model says to get a good fit

34
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:30,016
Let's go to a bit more detail how are we actually going to guess a measure of a discrepancy

35
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,808
What if there are three

36
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,344
Data points for example

37
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,648
If it's up for an hour wake up three points

38
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:40,512
Or there might be a hundred what did you have in mind and

39
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:42,816
Okay

40
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:47,168
So I got a window somewhere to collect Delta X

41
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:52,800
Chop up your day to world into little windows in size Delta racks

42
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,360
How many points are in each

43
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,640
Linda Grant

44
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:57,664
Okay

45
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:04,064
So we have Windows in the bins

46
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:08,928
So this is an example of how we get a measure of discrepancy

47
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:13,536
Preventive measure discrepancy and to do that we're going to put in bins

48
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,120
Which might look like

49
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,544
This webpage is not account then or if we are

50
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,568
Look like

51
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,432
Okay

52
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:35,808
I noticed something you have to choose was this

53
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,624
Had to be chosen

54
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,440
In order for this to work

55
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,720
Okay

56
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,536
Save-A-Lot School Ms

57
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:51,936
Well I'm at 2 at three of the count in each of these things

58
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,752
That we've got

59
00:03:55,776 --> 00:04:01,920
So you compare that with what the model with parameter Lambda would have per day

60
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,712
I'm guessing

61
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,248
So

62
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:09,344
Let me check if you agree with this

63
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:12,928
You could work out given Lambda

64
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,000
What the expected value

65
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,583
Of asked in a particular bin would be

66
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,655
And

67
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,471
That would give you

68
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,263
Expected number two

69
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,311
Half half half

70
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,615
Like that

71
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:36,991
When you

72
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:43,391
Talk about him some sort of measure of how far apart they are was it the distance between

73
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:46,207
Mountain View expected in mind

74
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:53,887
Some sort of inner product Okay so

75
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,167
All

76
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:58,495
One measure of goodness of fit

77
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:04,383
Which I was suggesting is we some overall the bends

78
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,247
The distance between FB and expected value of FB

79
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,295
Giving Lambda

80
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,903
Repetitive taking absolute value

81
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,671
Call

82
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:20,255
Square or something like that that was some of the squares Maybe

83
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,303
Is a measure of how close they are old

84
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,071
To each other

85
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,143
So that was the thing I was

86
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,191
Guessing

87
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:34,847
How about adult product goodness-of-fit to is a measure of how similar these two vectors to each other

88
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,407
In a product of FB

89
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,687
With

90
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,479
Pats Peak

91
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,807
All right

92
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,879
Let's just have a quick think about that

93
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,951
If we spend the square

94
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,023
We got some of that be

95
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,375
We get some of that to be square

96
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,495
Minus

97
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,847
To some of FB

98
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,127
FB

99
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,151
Averaged

100
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,455
Plus

101
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,991
Son of a b

102
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,295
Average of S&P

103
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,343
Squid

104
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:20,415
So if I

105
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,207
Minimize this thing

106
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:27,839
With respect to Lambda and if you maximize this thing with respect to Lambda

107
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:31,167
We're going to get pretty similar answers only because

108
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:35,519
Actually this is just a constant as long as we use the same bin sizes each other

109
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,311
About to constant

110
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,127
Once the bins been chosen

111
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:46,527
I miss Lawton okay

112
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:52,927
Things are actually quite similar

113
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:56,255
Not exactly identical because of this difference

114
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,815
Okay so you got to measure goodness of fit

115
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:03,935
And something you might have the back of your mind is all these questions that we have friends

116
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:10,335
? how did you choose Delta Rex

117
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,895
How to choose

118
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:15,711
Between different measures of goodness of fit

119
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,015
I'm not saying either of these is a good

120
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,063
The first one

121
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:26,463
Has anyone got another approach to this method to

122
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:32,863
Optimize gradient descent with suggested as long as we find

123
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:39,263
When we've done the optimization it will spit out I guess Alondra the best fit

124
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,591
Does anyone have

125
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:47,711
Another approach because there are many approaches you got taught when you'll be into it

126
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,503
Ad hoc statistical methods

127
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:54,111
I'm sure some of you thought of methods that don't look like

128
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,695
Jesse Owens

129
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:05,119
So what's the price of gas in his approach to answering the question what is Lambda

130
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,799
Okay so

131
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:16,895
What dancing do you have in mind for this this problem

132
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:21,759
Okay the data points that that x-coordinates

133
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:28,671
Okay the x-coordinate solve these guys are exponentially distributed maybe I need to make Claire walk the assumption

134
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,695
Prxn

135
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:32,255
Given Lambda and

136
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:35,327
The window edges A&B

137
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,607
Is

138
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:40,447
Vanessa exponential one of these

139
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,007
82 -

140
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,287
Facts

141
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,847
Lambda

142
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,943
If x is

143
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:55,039
Between a and b

144
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,063
And it

145
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,343
0

146
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:01,951
Otherwise

147
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,255
All right

148
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:09,631
Whereas it is the integral from A to B

149
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:12,191
People minus X on Lambda

150
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:17,567
So the actual probability density of each acts if we knew Lambda is an exponential

151
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:23,455
There are possibly some gas stations running around in this for example

152
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,479
If I

153
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,759
Define a bin

154
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:29,343
And if we measure the count of how many points are I did not been

155
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,183
It may be true that the probability distribution of that count

156
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:39,839
Which is actually a distribution of integers it may be reasonably well approximated that's impossible

157
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:43,679
Direction you could go in that the definitely does involve

158
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,703
Calciums

159
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:49,311
Does anyone else have a completely different approach to this

160
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,079
Problem

161
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,407
Did anyone study Physics

162
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,479
No one else

163
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,783
Yeah ok Google

164
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,831
Isn't it the case that when

165
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:04,159
Little young physicists I told to do stuff with that data

166
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,695
Fat toad

167
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,975
Get the data

168
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:13,631
Rearrange the equation that predicts the data given the premises in such a way that got a straight line graph

169
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:16,959
Straight line isn't that one of the rules of had to do

170
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,239
Statistical inference

171
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:23,359
So let me run with that idea

172
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,407
Sir

173
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,479
Best wispy of xn

174
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,783
Given Lambda a + b

175
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:37,183
62 - x on Lambda

176
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,231
/ that

177
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:42,303
I said depends on Lambda AA on big

178
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,655
If we got a load of points Acts

179
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:52,031
How can we turn this love into some sort of straight line well

180
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,055
Let's

181
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:59,455
First X little window as we had before been size P of X and given Lambda AMV

182
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:01,247
X Delta X

183
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,551
That's now

184
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,135
The

185
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:13,535
Probability that the next point will fool in this particular been located at

186
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,303
Skibidi

187
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,375
Analysts think of this as a function of x

188
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:23,519
This is the probability that the next point will full in a bin of size X plus minus

189
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:25,823
I've been

190
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,151
Or would sell tax located on X approximately all right

191
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:33,759
So if I multiply that by the total number Vega points we got

192
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,551
Which is an

193
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,671
That's the expected

194
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,463
Number

195
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,511
In a bin

196
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:49,631
And that is equal to and on Zaid

197
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,935
A two- axon Lambda

198
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:54,495
We want some way of turning this

199
00:11:54,751 --> 00:12:00,639
Expected number which will relate to that to measure number into some sort of straight line

200
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:03,199
Thing that would measuring his ex so that's

201
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,735
A variable list

202
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,783
Changes as you move the been around

203
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,831
Under the / Lambda

204
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:14,463
That's horrible but we physicists we know how to get rid of exponential to take the log

205
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,255
And

206
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,471
So you can have the log

207
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:28,031
Of the expected count

208
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,823
In

209
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:36,479
I've been at x with with Delta X

210
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,783
The log of expected count

211
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:44,159
Is log off and on Zed which is something the constant

212
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:47,231
Minus X

213
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,535
Lambda

214
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:59,519
That's not a straight line with an intercept of something-or-other and a slope of -1

215
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,287
Linda

216
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,079
All right

217
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:06,943
So if you've been subjected to the physics

218
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:13,343
Training the size of a high school thing to do is take the money and get a straight line

219
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:16,671
And everyone knows how to say so

220
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:20,767
I didn't number one was

221
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,047
Let's

222
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:28,703
Put the diaper to Ben's I got a histogram that doesn't solve the problem when I need to do something with a histogram

223
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:35,103
Things we could do with a histogram notice I've done it twice and it was fat beans one

224
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:39,455
Time to just emphasize the answer we end up with may depend on the size of a penis

225
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,807
His the

226
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:48,159
Physics education idea to take the log of your Instagram then fit a straight line

227
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,719
So the suggestion is

228
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,767
Take the actual data

229
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,119
The thing that is true is that the log of the expected number is

230
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,167
Some constant minus X on Lambda

231
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:02,239
But we're not going to do is take the actual beta

232
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,519
FB

233
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,311
Who can take the log of that

234
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,407
Unplug that against tax

235
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,783
And what I'm going to fit a straight line

236
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:21,439
Is a lot of extra questions getting raised by this approach when we say fit a straight line

237
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:27,839
How to fix a straight line to just use this straight line fitting thing that comes on your computer that's probably won't

238
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,607
To do

239
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:33,471
But something that could very easily be the case is when you define your bins

240
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:39,871
If you define them before you actually get today to it to the sort of correct way to do classical statistics you shouldn't change up

241
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,919
Best way to ask to look at it

242
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:46,783
It could well be the case that won bin might have their accounts in it

243
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,855
Not when you take the log of 0

244
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,903
You going to have and not been

245
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:58,815
Log of 0 you have an infinitely negative value to put into your straight line fishing method

246
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,887
So

247
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:06,239
It all sounds pretty good and it looks fairly good what if you get lucky

248
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:08,287
Up on the screen

249
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:13,151
With nice fat Benz and lots of data you can see a straight line

250
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,943
I was going to give you the rights

251
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:18,271
Universal method for answering problems

252
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,111
So just use to Benny's

253
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:24,927
Okay so here's another suggestion

254
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,719
Take the data

255
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:29,791
Put it in only two bins

256
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:36,191
I know we going to fix the bins before hunt or Willie set the boundary between the bins

257
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:42,847
What you wanting to do is make sure we got some points in each bin yeah and then do something

258
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:45,919
This is a number 3

259
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:48,223
You fit a straight line

260
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:55,903
I didn't number for is just used to bins but be smart about where you put the bin battery

261
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,463
Three points

262
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,767
What are the two bins going to be

263
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,791
Wicked

264
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:08,191
Well hello hello hello

265
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:13,311
I have two in one bed and one in the other or one in one and two in the other

266
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:16,127
It's a nice idea it's probably

267
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,919
It was probably something in it

268
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:23,807
But it still got pitfalls namely if you actually end up with two points you trying to struggle

269
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:27,647
Because of the loss of all between us now by the way you put your Ben batteries

270
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,463
Okay

271
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,279
Are there any other suggestions

272
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:36,607
Pat's exhausted a whole bunch of different laser

273
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,167
Making been putting it into Benz

274
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:42,495
And then doing something with those histograms

275
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,031
What other ideas

276
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:53,247
Okay so another suggestion suggestion number 5

277
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,015
It is

278
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,551
Could we look at

279
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,599
The cumulative distribution

280
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,463
So

281
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:04,255
His ID number five

282
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:10,655
If I give you some data like that you can deduce from it

283
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:13,215
Image of distribution which is nothing

284
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,751
1

285
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,031
She said

286
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,823
3/3

287
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,919
So that's the cumulative

288
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:27,039
Distribution function from any particular hypothesis

289
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:33,183
It says what Lavender is used to find the probability density

290
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,975
CDF

291
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:37,791
For that value of Lambda which will be

292
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,839
Something like that

293
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:40,863
Okay

294
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:46,751
And now we've got a thing that has little steps and it wherever they Point happened to come

295
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:49,567
And we could repeat now

296
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:54,431
Let's have a measure of how close this is to this

297
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,247
Now we need to decide what time is replacements

298
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:04,159
And where do we measure it so we can measure it here in here in here in San Antonio

299
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,695
Distances between

300
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,719
These two

301
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,047
CVS

302
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:17,215
How many topping way of measuring distances between the two differences of decision about

303
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,799
What's the density of points at which we measure the difference

304
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,079
Albuquerque

305
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,895
Well I only care about the TGIF in this weekend

306
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,175
Hawaii

307
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,599
Does an issue of

308
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,879
How do you measure

309
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:41,279
I need to come up with ways of measuring how close

310
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,815
Ccdf soft

311
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:46,655
And I do that is a problem because it means there's an infinite number of ways

312
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:49,471
But answering the question how do we fit

313
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,239
Lambda

314
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,031
2 States at what we think Landry's

315
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:55,359
So we could do things with TDS

316
00:18:55,871 --> 00:19:00,479
That would get rid of Ben wittes but it still leaves some interesting questions leftover yes

317
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:08,671
Brilliant okay so how do we find the mean of a gaussian distribution

318
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:14,303
Well we just take snacks and we some of us it was right by Anne

319
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:20,703
I'm not giving us the number

320
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,239
Enfig options

321
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:27,359
New hot equals x bar

322
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:33,759
So that's something we can do with no bins at all we can take all of these days we can take some of that sand

323
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,879
Because the windows going to left hand side remember the left hand side of the window

324
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,671
Is at a

325
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:45,791
They don't have any points to less that I made it would be sensible to subtract a

326
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:56,031
Now that's an interesting thing about the me

327
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,847
Distance from

328
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,151
And that clearly has

329
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:07,807
Unexpected dependent on land of the big of a value Lambda has the more the Pine-Sol search to the

330
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:11,391
Right hand side and eventually The Middle on average

331
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:14,207
If you have a really large

332
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,511
Then you have a uniform distribution

333
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:20,351
So this isn't precisely related to Lambda

334
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,423
But in the case goes to Infinity

335
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:27,007
If the window is infinitely wide on the right hand side

336
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:28,031
Then

337
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:34,687
Something you might remember about exponential distributions is the meaning of this guy

338
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:37,247
Is Ethan mine effects on Lambda now

339
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,271
With no window

340
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:43,391
The mean of this distribution is Lambda

341
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,487
Okay expected value Max is Lambda

342
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:53,119
So I think that's a really good idea to say maybe there's something in the idea of computing to me

343
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,031
Absolutely we can

344
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:04,639
Let's have a measure discrepancy between the

345
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:05,919
And

346
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,199
The predicted me

347
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:12,319
Let's imagine doing that it is not a very difficult calculation to do

348
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,720
I will keep asking questions as well

349
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,096
Set

350
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,656
The expected value of x

351
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:29,984
For the real distribution is the integral from A to B

352
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,288
8 - x on Lambda

353
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,616
Text / Zedd

354
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:43,040
And you cancel that and it's a function all day being lined up so this is some sort of

355
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,088
Escort new off

356
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:47,648
Hey Atlanta

357
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,280
If this is a

358
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,560
This is B

359
00:21:55,072 --> 00:22:00,192
How much is Lambda what Mew actually looks like his is roughly Linea down here

360
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:00,960
And then

361
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:02,752
It flattens out like that

362
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,592
So that's what you of

363
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:09,152
Baby in London actually looks like

364
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:15,808
Another suggestion is take all the title take your 1000.4 your message to enormous precision

365
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:18,624
The throw away all of the position of that and just out of mouth

366
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:19,904
Okay

367
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:25,024
Why did you compute the mean you're throwing it all away love information there

368
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,840
Information

369
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,936
But you can do it and then

370
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:33,984
You got to do something with this kind of hair

371
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,592
So you would come out what the actual datamine is

372
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,896
So you bring a long ax bar

373
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:45,248
Define the actual me

374
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:52,672
Which I'm not a defining to be the sum of X and Iran

375
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:56,256
You bring it along and use it through this line

376
00:22:56,512 --> 00:23:00,352
Can you plop it downstairs and you said okay there is an estimator

377
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,376
Salamander

378
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,168
Not what you had in mind

379
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,216
I like that idea

380
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,056
Don't have any beans in it

381
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:12,384
But it didn't go very big step for saying I'm going to compute the me

382
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,176
And you could have said

383
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:20,576
I'm going to compute the variance or I'm going to compute V moment or you could have invented a whole load of other things to make

384
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,880
And then you could have plotted them

385
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:26,976
As a function of Lambda so another thing

386
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:31,328
Could have been plotted as a function of Lambda

387
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:36,960
And then you got to your day turn you come down and say or it could be anybody

388
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:44,128
Not an infinite family of things that you could do I think this is a brilliant idea and you'll see why in a moment

389
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,736
Does an infant number of things you could invent which depend on Lambda

390
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,528
And you could

391
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:55,392
Pick one of those and then measure it and use it to come back and get an estimate of Lambda

392
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:00,000
So that's another thing that is done in Costco statistics

393
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,280
And it

394
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,072
Can often be done well

395
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:08,960
And you can also get in trouble cuz what if the 3-day points is a is B

396
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,824
That could happen right

397
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,360
You got any free points

398
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,664
Rolls-Royce

399
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,480
The midpoint

400
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:24,320
So now you work out the mean and it's above the midpoint of a b

401
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:27,904
And now you don't know what to do because your methods head

402
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,208
Come across from the title value and read down

403
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,256
And I haven't got an answer anymore

404
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:33,536
Okay

405
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:39,168
There's lots of ways to solve problems the wrong way

406
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:44,800
I'm reminded of a Penn and Teller video at Penn and Teller studying a controversial topic

407
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:45,824
And

408
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,360
Hotnewhiphop

409
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:54,528
And they interview a guy who has also the reason for the engine UK and they say we believe in violence on our show so

410
00:24:54,784 --> 00:25:00,416
We gave attempts to every part of you express from the idiot now let's hear from a guy who's right

411
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:07,328
Let's now so this inference problem using Bayes theorem and there will be a unique answer

412
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:13,984
He'll be one answer to the public in any case with any case with any amount of data 3 days

413
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,520
3000 data points

414
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:17,568
Angela National think

415
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:23,456
You got the right answer you don't need to choose being sizes you don't need to invent measures of goodness of fit

416
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:30,112
You don't need to invent interesting functions like the meaning of the data which in this case is a brilliant holiday

417
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,184
Put another problems

418
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:36,256
You might struggle to think of the brilliant idea

419
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:43,168
You don't actually need to think you need to know what you're doing

420
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,960
Need to get it right

421
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:47,008
But it is a mechanical

422
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,848
And it don't take yours

423
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:53,152
To get used to doing things the Basin way

424
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,968
So how does it work

425
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,272
All right

426
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:04,160
So here's a list of other ideas that people I can come up with I think we've gone through them

427
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:08,000
Open when I asked the question how would you solve this problem

428
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,792
People say Chi Squared

429
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:14,656
And that goes back to the bins story have to count in the bin

430
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:17,472
Many measure the difference between accountant expected

431
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,008
He's getting for chi-square

432
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,544
So that

433
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,872
We already had that roughly in methods 1 and 2

434
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:27,968
Images of Arrow between the fairy in the beta

435
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:29,504
Look at the day to me

436
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:35,392
And see how that very lined up or pick some other quantity and see how that varies with Lambda

437
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:37,952
Any ideas

438
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:41,024
That are out there and I will do it using Bass Down

439
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:45,632
That's right down again what's the probability of the data is

440
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:51,264
For single data point given Lambda

441
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:55,616
This distribution is 8 -

442
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,896
Text my mom.

443
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:04,064
Is that is the indigo

444
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,880
Thanks

445
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,952
Online de

446
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,768
I need to do the integral

447
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:20,448
It's not hot it is Lambda Eastman - aeon lender Finance

448
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:22,496
Reminder speed on Lambda

449
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:27,104
I really want to emphasize how easy and straightforward and simple with his

450
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,384
And

451
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:35,040
It's just a few lines of computer code cuz all you need to not put into your computer is this statement which Define

452
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,832
PMX giving Lunde

453
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:42,208
And then you put in this one which defines house that depends on Lambda

454
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:47,584
And now you're done because it says that you can infer Lambda

455
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:52,704
Given by just multiplying together

456
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:58,080
All these things are so you have

457
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:00,896
How late is 1 + 11

Angelo Devita - x 10

459
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:05,504
On

460
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,528
Lambda

461
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:13,440
Is that is a function of Lambda Lambda

462
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:15,232
Depends on x

463
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:17,792
Does Linda Pennington hair this length

464
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,584
Flying together

465
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:25,984
And that that is your likelihood so this is the only active

466

Honda

467
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:32,384
They multiply that by what Avenue about Lambda beforehand

Andino mice

469
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:45,696
And this is the uninteresting normalizing costumes that you don't care about if all you want to do is

470
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:48,000
Compatible scientific theories about Lambda

471
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:51,840
Let's look at the meeting yesterday too dependent best

472
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:55,680
And this is where the first time you see this

473
00:28:55,936 --> 00:29:00,800
I find it just thrilling to automatically happens

474
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,336
You take this function

475
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:05,152
Let's stick with the slice

476
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:08,480
His the code you need to write down

477
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:13,344
I've written it and blue fault which is a language that you can use to define functions

478
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,368
Time Portland

479
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:17,952
It's hard to find a function P of X and Al which is

480
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,744
Dysfunction hat

481
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,328
X and Lambda Lambda sternadel on the bus

482
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:26,656
So the top line to find P the second line to find Zedge

483
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:31,264
Define said slightly differently put the one over Alan to the PA

484
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,544
But it's

485
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,568
That's a good one

486
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,128
Redefine a redefine B

487
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,152
And then

488
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:43,552
We can float these as a function of X which is the normal way of placing these things so you fix Lambda

489
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:51,744
Any plot of x given Lambda as a function of X and it looks like

490
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,536
Very normal

491
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:58,400
So that's what it looks like the three different values of Lambda

492
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:01,472
How to have a very smooth

493
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,264
Welcome to my time left

494
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,056
Happy big Lambda

495
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,152
Uniform distribution

496
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:16,064
But every one of these probabilities integrates to Wong and it's a little very normal

497
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,880
Find the area under

498
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,160
The Green Cove

499
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:27,072
Is also

500
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:30,656
That's all very standard and very simple in the chest exponential's

501
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:34,496
And then baystorm says like I know you want to know the line with the given actually just

502
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,776
Plot the same function

503
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:36,800
But look at it

504
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,080
How's the function of Lambda

505
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:41,920
Play take these innocent exponential functions I'm looking the other way around

506
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:47,040
And this is what they look like so this is the probability of x

507
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,320
Given

508
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:49,856
Lambda

509
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:53,440
Sorry it's not

510
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:55,232
Okay

511
00:30:56,512 --> 00:31:02,656
Ind.vs to do this we need to fix that to a particular value so I'm showing you three different

512
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:06,240
Time for three different possible accessrx good bo3

513
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:12,896
This is what direction Lambda looks like for 3 Lite Luca

514
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:14,688
The five it's the blue one

515
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,736
12 it's the purple one

516
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,320
An amazing thing is just one of those functions

517
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,112
Take a Bow

518
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:28,512
If we fix x-23 and then plot of x given Lambda as a function of Lambda

519
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,792
The horizontal axis hair

520
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,584
And I put it on a log scale

521
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:33,632
It's got a pink

522
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,936
So a single data point

523
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:38,752
Is not giving you this nice PC function and saying

524
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:40,032
That

525
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:44,896
Just one datapoint that happened to arrive at

526
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:46,944
X = 3

527
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:51,040
That one day 2.90 tells dude

528
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:55,904
Tell Jason opinions you won't have about different values of Lambda

529
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,792
Extremely small values of Lambda close to zero

530
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,608
Essentially ruled out by us

531
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:09,216
Values of land initiative to also

532
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:12,032
Tiffany happy they did a good job before the dance

533
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,568
Matilija values

534
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:18,432
A slightly ruthann but nobody much they just slightly penalize compared to

535
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:20,736
Lambda is too also

536
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:27,392
So just one datapoint

537
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:31,744
Can tell you something about what language should be and as you piling more more data points

538
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:34,304
Multiply these functions by each other

539
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:38,144
The special case of a data point this out beyond the midpoint

540
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:40,704
Gives you the purple line here

541
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:47,104
Which STI can we can definitely rule out tiny bodies of Lambda there's no way Lambda could be Point 10.3 or something like that

542
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,688
I got a pint at 12 that's crazy so that's ruled out

543
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:56,832
But all values of Lambda from 10-20-30 100 day rule equally probable

544
00:32:57,344 --> 00:33:00,672
Predictive estate appoint equally well

545
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:07,328
Because they will protect essentially uniform distribution so that equally unsurprised by saying evaluation

546
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,096
12

547
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:10,656
Okay

548
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:12,448
So we will play these together

549
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:19,104
When you multiply those functions together hair of X functions imagining that there are just three days points at three 5

550
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,688
5 and 12 * speak

551
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,296
We can

552
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:32,416
I think a bit more about what this function actually is how does the function depend on the data

553
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:38,816
Well this particular function depends on the writer MSY

554
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:43,936
Let's go eat in the minors

555
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:46,240
Suck it up staff Ethan Miner

556
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,776
Sum of x n

557
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,360
Atlanta

558
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:55,712
Is all you need to know in fact

559
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:59,552
So I'm rewriting the likelihood

560
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:09,024
So the brilliant intuition that said why don't you just compute the mean of the data is exactly right

561
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:15,424
Exponential then the only thing you need to know is the sum

562
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:17,984
And then you can work out the lights

563
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,544
So you don't actually need to know all the data points

564
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,104
You just need some of them

565
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,688
Because of this particular form

566
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,992
All of the probability density

567
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:33,088
If the model didn't look like this it wouldn't be in the meeting that is the thing you need to know

568
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:39,488
The lessons of the alphabet is not computer

569
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:47,424
What you need to do is look at the likelihood function under like its function will tell you what you want to do with your date and in this case

570
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,216
Find the mean

571
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:50,240
And then

572
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:54,592
Good function and on the screen we have a likely function math

573
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,384
And

574
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:57,920
I can

575
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:01,504
Recreate these cuz we're just looking at

576
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,528
Again

577
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,320
So

578
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,880
Here are

579
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,928
I'll just repeat the sequence I did

580
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:15,328
Here are three probability densities over data Space X

581
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:19,680
You could imagine getting data at Point such as 3 or 5 or 12

582
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:26,336
The predictions of these different models of different values of Lambda a simple exponential that's something you can know.

583
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,432
Is there a places for example the left-hand Blue Line

584
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:33,504
Where the red is above the oranges above the yellow

585
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,552
So the Red Wings it predicted that

586
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:38,880
The places where the yellow is above the oranges above the red

587
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:41,952
Under places where the oranges top

588
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:44,768
So there are outcomes

589
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,352
Such that any of those three can be the winner in terms of having

590
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,376
Predicted Betha

591
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,656
Then the other two

592
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,448
That's another way of saying

593
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:56,032
When then they will be at Peak

594
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,056
As a function

595
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:58,336
Lambda

596
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:01,664
So now we do that we put the likelihood function

597
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:06,016
And this is the likelihood multiplying together those three

598
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,576
Numbers

599
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:16,000
I'm not showing in red orange and yellow cat just three values of Lambda that we were considering remember that we looked at Landry's

600
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:17,280
25 + 10

601
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,328
This is when you get data

602
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:23,424
MP3

603
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:24,960
At the three points

604
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,264
I mentioned before

605
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,056
Okay

606
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,848
Step one more time

607
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:31,872
What's going on

608
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:41,856
Triangle

609
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:45,440
Okay

610
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:48,256
So just getting through the sequence again

611
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,816
His three places you could get data

612
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:55,680
I left on point points to the red hypothesis being the most probable

613
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,752
Datavant at 5

614
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:02,080
Prefers by publish The Landry something like five

615
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:06,432
And they Point inside prefer to be 10 or so

616
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:08,736
To the hypothesis that Landers 205

617
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:14,880
So this is what the likelihood look like if you got just one data point that is respectively at 3 or 5 or 12

618
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:18,464
And this is the product of x

619
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:19,744
Okay

620
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,560
That face serum

621
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:25,376
So finding a single parameter Lambda

622
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:28,448
Wasn't that easy because all you have to do

623
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,472
Was right

624
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:30,752
Essentially

625
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:32,032
Warm

626
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:33,056
2

627
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:35,104
Three lines

628
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:39,456
Define the function and now we've got this bump that tells us

629
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:40,480
The answer

630
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:43,040
What time does Walt how well

631
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:47,392
Predicted points

632
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:49,696
Another word for 3000 datapoints as well

633
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:50,720
Yeah

634
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,840
Okay who said anything about picking Lambda

635
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:59,936
The question said what is Lambda and I think the correct way to answer that

636
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:04,032
Is either do you really want me to take less Lambda if so tell me how

637
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:10,432
But if someone says what is Landry I think the correct way to answer that question is whether it's roughly this O+ o- this the way

638
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,456
Answer my question

639
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:14,016
How heavy is this book

640
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:16,576
I don't want to get a give me a number

641
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:19,904
I wanted to say well it could be

642
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,488
Do underground + -100 I'm not very good at estimating weight to books

643
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,280
So

644
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:29,888
Dumb question said what is Lambda it didn't say provide a single point estimate

645
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:33,216
If you want the point estimate guess what I might maximize the likelihood

646
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,496
But

647
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:41,152
I'm not addicted to maximizing like it's because you could get silly answers remember when we go we're looking in the gas industry

648
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:41,920
Division

649
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:44,480
I miss the gaussian with a single data point

650
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:46,784
Had infinitely big likelihood

651
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,600
Down here this is Mew

652
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:54,464
Are Swiss log Sigma Nu

653
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:58,304
Maximizing like it it doesn't have any fundamental status

654
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:05,728
It may well be better than a whole lot of other ways of doing things and principal

655
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:06,752
Can be dangerous

656
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:13,664
What would I say is answer I would return the likelihood and if someone wants a quick summary of rough

657
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,200
What the likelihood looks like

658
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:19,552
I would see if I can find a peek and I'd give some description of Hyrule Deepika

659
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,088
So

660
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:25,440
A very common thing you can do with a tail like this is if you got more than three datapoints

661
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:29,280
You can probably make a gassy and fit to that blue cup on the screen

662
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:32,864
What is the formula for it

663
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:38,752
A function that will compute the likelihood and here is a Galaxy an approximation to that it's called this mean in this standard deviation

664
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,336
So that the general method I'd I'd suggest

665
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:43,872
But often works well

666
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,920
You take your likelihood function

667
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,992
And your proxmate

668
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:51,040
The likelihood

669
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,648
Buy I got a chance baby

670
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:59,744
That isn't the rule but it's a suggestion

671
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:07,168
When you approximated by gas you need to describe what you need to decide what the variable on the horizontal axis is

672
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,728
Characters in have log Lambda

673
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:15,616
You could also have lemon womxn don't hold graphic looks excited

674
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:20,480
And I got an approximation in one space may not be as good as it can I send another

675
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,952
Okay the question is

676
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:31,744
Looking at these three

677
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,816
Likelihood for single data points on the top of the screen

678
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:39,680
Does the yellow one which is the probability of producing Mexico's 12

679
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,984
As a function of Lambda

680
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:48,384
Does it have a pika tool as Lambda goes to infinity and the answer is no always values of Lambda give identical

681
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,944
Prediction so it just asymptotes to

682
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:52,992
The value 1 - 19

683
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:55,808
Because the window is 19 wide

684
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,624
And so all of those in the limit

685
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,464
Put that probability density uniformly over 19 at space

686
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,000
19 centimeters wide

687
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:13,472
Yes it if you change the width of the window from being 19 centimeters wide

688
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:15,776
To being sad

689
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:17,056
190

690
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:23,456
Centimeters life then it would have a peek again just as for three and five at any point the left hand side of the midpoint

691
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:24,736
You got a pink

692
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:31,392
That that's the rough rule of thumb think I'm writing but I said that

693
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:32,928
Mythical aesthetic

694
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,232
Yes

695
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:40,096
Could the likelihood function have multiple Peaks

696
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:43,168
Definitely in general it could for this problem account

697
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:49,568
Mitsudomoe total for this problem but in general like food functions can go all over the place and we will come up with many examples of

698
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,592
Sebastian future elections

699
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:58,527
Okay what I want to do now is I want to move on or you can do this for any day just that says another day just

700
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:02,111
Chat with just three points and 1.7

701
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:06,207
That still only three data points but it is much more shot PP

702
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:11,327
So it depends on what the data actually turn out to be how sharp your likelihood will be

703
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:17,727
It is possible with three points old left hand side they can get quite a good estimate of of Lambda just from three days

704
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:22,847
An approach that use bins of a fixed size it was fixed before the date arrived

705
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:25,919
Will probably be hopeless at this sort of thing function

706
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:29,503
Don't the right thing for you when you can get a very precise answer for Lambda

707
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:32,063
Even given any three data points it gives you that

708
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:38,463
So we hate putting date went to Ben's and her off of the likely function because you'll never need to use Ben's ever again

709
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:40,255
Okay

710
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,047
I want to finish

711
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,839
The next 15 minutes

712
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:45,887
With another question

713
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:49,215
The topic for today it's like Shelton

714
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:54,335
But something for today is inference of parameters and models

715
00:42:54,847 --> 00:43:00,735
And if I gave you something to like this and if I didn't just say they come from

716
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:05,599
I'm not actually sure if it's from one Lambda warm exponential maybe there's a mixture

717
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:06,879
Of exponentials

718
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:10,207
Please tell me what I should think about that

719
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:15,583
Is it credible given the state so that it comes from two guys Ian's rosin far to exponential

720
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,119
Robin just one

721
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:19,679
How do we solve that problem

722
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:20,959
Well

723
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:22,751
Let's write down

724
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:24,287
FaceTime again

725
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:32,735
Habitats your neighbor about how to solve this problem when I want to build

726
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:36,575
Okay

727
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:40,415
So what we going to do now is we're going to introduce two hypotheses

728
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:43,231
One is hypothesis wrong with your testing working on

729
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:44,767
Hypothesis wrong

730
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:47,583
Which is named after the number promises it's gone

731
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:50,399
The number of exponentials

732
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:52,447
Here it is

733
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:55,775
And this is how we fit H1 to the data

734
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:57,055
Phishing involves

735
00:43:57,567 --> 00:44:01,407
Thinking what its Lambda it one parameter Lambda might be

736
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:06,527
And the prior

737
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:10,879
I didn't even specify what it was the sort of thing you might do

738
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:11,903
And this

739
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:16,255
If it were a real life problem you might think a little bit about

740
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:21,375
If you know anything about lavender already know if it was shorter then something or other then

741
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:26,495
The universe will explode if it was a bigger than we will be dad might be

742
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:32,895
A range of values a pretty shoalanda must be within if you really don't know anything about that

743
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:36,223
You might be tempted to have some sort of uniform prior

744
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:37,759
Petrino's values

745
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:43,647
It actually depends what the problem is what you should do about it think it is subjective and that's the way

746
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:44,415
I think

747
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,695
It has to be

748
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:46,719
And

749
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:53,631
Set the sort of thing that the prior might be is some beautiful mixed distribution over some broad range of

750
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,679
Vlog Lambda

751
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:57,983
Okay

752
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:04,383
I'm not saying I have to be that way that's just the way I often work if I have real inference problems

753
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:07,967
Positive quantity Lambda Decay length

754
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:14,111
I'll tend to think of the log of that variable is an actual way to work with it and then they put the product on the look of it

755
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:16,671
Robin directly on Lambert South

756
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:20,767
What this implies for the prior lender is that it may be a bit of a

757
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:24,095
Lopsided looking a bit like

758
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:27,423
This because this prior is saying that

759
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:32,287
Value such as .1 + 1 + 10 + 100

760
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:34,847
Parole just as likely as as each other

761
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:36,383
That means

762
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,919
Tobias if you liked it

763
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:39,199
Small veins

764
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:43,295
Okay

765
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:48,671
Stop I haven't obsessed about his prime but it's going to become slightly more important than the moving

766
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:52,511
When I went to DCFS a second hypothesis

767
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:54,559
And the second hypothesis

768
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:59,935
Says that the probability density of x if you knew Lambda want an alarm to 2

769
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:07,615
And if you knew quotes to let go and Pie one pie to which of the weights of the two exponential

770
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:11,711
To be the length scales in these a how much probability Masters in each of them

771
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,063
The public works

772
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:20,159
Given those promises and H2 is

773
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:23,231
8 + -6

774
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:25,535
Online level one

775
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:37,055
+ 8 - x 2 x weight

776
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:37,823
Taiwan

777
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:42,687
Simplicity

778
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:46,783
We could pretend to the left hand side of the window is it

779
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:49,343
Zero from now on

780
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,111
But

781
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:53,695
So that is

782
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:55,999
A mixture of two

783
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:58,047
Exponentials

784
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:00,351
And

785
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:05,471
Let's retract what I just said this is true parole activity 9B

786
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:08,799
I'm at 0 otherwise

787
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:17,503
Okay so H2 has two interesting promises Lambda Lambda to another couple of promises by one pipe

788
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:22,367
Switch off positive

789
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:23,647
And

790
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:27,999
To get on with it I'm going to declare so I'll

791
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:30,047
Cathedral by life inside

792
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:34,143
Half of the Masters in what exponential health is in the oven

793
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:36,447
And

794
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:43,103
I didn't have to do that it would just make it a bit easier to do what we're about to do so the motor will only have two parameters

795
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,639
Rather than three

796
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:49,759
End

797
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:51,807
We can do infants with both of them

798
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:58,207
So we can infer land of an alarm to 2

799
00:47:58,975 --> 00:47:59,999
Given

800
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:02,303
Other than beta

801
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:08,191
Imagine gold controller

802
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:09,727
X

803
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:12,287
Given on the 1 alarm to 2

804
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:14,591
Which is the product of all of these things

805
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:22,271
I'm not suppressing the pies because I just arbitrarily decided that I wanted

806
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:25,599
We have a prior on the tool

807
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:37,887
So that's how we

808
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:41,215
To put it crudely fix model 2

809
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:42,239
To the beta

810
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:45,823
Robert Howey in full on the 111th to give me the date

811
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:52,223
I need to know that we don't care about because it's just analyzing constant if it were doing is thinking what we

812
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:54,271
Believeland should be

813
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:58,367
However if we know what to do model comparison

814
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:06,559
Then what we want to do is say how probably is I-81 given today

815
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:10,399
And he'll probably late to get in the beta

816
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:16,287
An answer to this question can also be found by based on the rules of probability

817
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:22,687
Starting from our assumptions of day to give an H1 times what have y'all probably fit h-11

818
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:27,039
/ normalizing customs

819
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:30,879
Unless one is the probability of the data

820
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:35,487
Multiply 5 equivalent to

821
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:40,095
/ the same

822
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:44,191
And if you like I'm suppressing hair

823
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:47,263
Some further assumptions it's all depends on

824
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:49,311
Wish we could cool

825
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:51,103
That's what I

826
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:54,943
Other assumptions severe is a Rolex

827
00:49:55,455 --> 00:50:00,063
A key assumption here is the assumption that either there's two exponential's

828
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,599
Well this one exponential

829
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:03,903
And this assumption about the prize

830
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:05,695
Premises

831
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:08,511
So all of these things depend on

832
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:10,559
Is Romania

833
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:13,887
I'm not wanting to hide

834
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:21,823
So the beautiful things to know just ask is if you have Kathleen sold problem one which was please fit model 1

835
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:25,919
But if you have Kathy so probably too

836
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:31,295
Infidel and Wonderland tutu and if you have done that in a way that

837
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:39,743
Is normalizing constant if you didn't just ignore it but you computed it when you are solving

838
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:43,583
This inference are in fruits

839
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:48,703
If you got the normalizing constant

840
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:50,751
That is exactly what you need

841
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:53,055
In order to do this

842
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:58,431
Bayesian inference are the dates of dependent time and the other one

843
00:50:59,199 --> 00:50:59,967
If you have ever had

844
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,551
Lost my green

845
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:06,879
So that's, that's pretty red

846
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:10,719
Vista life in constant

847
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:12,767
In Fridley rad

848
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:14,559
Is this one here

849
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:20,959
So we have

850
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:23,775
Parameter inference

851
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:30,175
How many done because if you did you promise her properly and you don't know why isn't Coulson you've already done model comparison

852
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:32,223
What you need in order to do mobile comparison

853
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:36,063
So let me step you through this and I'm going to

854
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:42,719
Do it in a slightly different way from what I wrote down here what I just described Haywood what just fine function of

855
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:45,535
Xlong Devon and Lambda 2

856
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:51,167
I'm about to / Zant right at all

857
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:55,263
The Wonder Woman lemon

858
00:51:57,311 --> 00:52:01,151
So we put a function of X number 1 number 2

859
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:02,943
And you can just

860
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:04,479
Multiply dokodemo

861
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:05,503
And then normalize

862
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:08,319
But there's another way of thinking about what's going on here

863
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:11,391
Which is if you believe it was to exponentials

864
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:12,927
And you get a lot of data

865
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:18,815
You can imagine

866
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:23,679
Deja came out and some of them are colored White

867
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:26,751
And some of them

868
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:27,519
Red

869
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:32,895
And the color can be telling you which exponential that came from

870
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:34,431
The white was

871
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:35,967
I'm the one

872
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:39,295
Red

873
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,575
Islam the two

874
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:41,599
For example

875
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:45,439
And then

876
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:49,535
Someone was true of you and I rub that all the colors and just told you that coordinates

877
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:51,583
But you could imagine

878
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:54,655
Trying to infer what those missing colors wear

879
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:58,495
We could do an inference that involves naming those missing colors

880
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:02,079
So I'm going to rewrite now mobile 2

881
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:05,151
I'm going to say that my will has in it

882
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:09,759
Alarm 2

883
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:14,623
Next

884
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:15,647
XM

885
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:21,023
Cayenne

886
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:23,839
The van going from walk to end

887
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:25,887
I'm not the way that we

888
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:30,751
Get all of the data if we New London to is we first pick a color

889
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:32,543
And then we draw

890
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:33,823
The point

891
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,615
From

892
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:36,639
That

893
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:40,223
We draw the the next point

894
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:41,247
From

895
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:44,063
The distribution condition on McCullough

896
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:46,623
Sir

897
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:56,607
We can write this as

898
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:58,399
Probability with colors

899
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:01,215
Reminder 1 alarm to 2

900
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:08,639
Find the probability of x

901
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,967
Given the color

902
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:16,319
And

903
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:19,903
We can put a product

904
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:24,255
Product from 1 to n

905
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:26,303
Technicolor

906
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:27,583
Man

907
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:28,607
Pickaxe

908
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:31,167
Okay

909
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:36,287
Then we can do a variety of inferences we can

910
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:37,567
Still

911
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:40,383
Work out the probability of Lambda Lambda to if we want

912
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:46,783
But we can also do other things we could work out how probable is it the correct coloring of all these

913
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:47,807
Point is

914
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:51,903
KN from 1 to n given

915
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:59,327
And assuming that a 2 is true

916
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,887
We can ask questions like that

917
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:08,287
And what we think

918
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:12,639
Alarm 2 to give him the daytime

919
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:14,175
Which is the question we just

920
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:18,015
Does the range of

921
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:19,807
Of questions we can ask

922
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:21,087
And I'm going to

923
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:22,623
Enumerate

924
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:27,999
Listen to I talk to space off different hypotheses about Lando on Atlanta to

925
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:28,767
And

926
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:29,791
Cayenne

927
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:31,839
So what I'm going to show you now

928
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:35,167
Cuz I like the computer

929
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:43,615
To show us

930
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:48,479
How well the beta off predictive

931
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:53,855
As a function of time to warm to the colors

932
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:05,375
Likelihood function so I'm not increasing the number of parameters in my problem from 2 to 1/2

933
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:07,935
Whatever NSR event is

934
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:10,751
8 I'm getting myself a type of 10 parameters

935
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:12,799
Two real numbers

936
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:13,823
And then

937
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,615
10 * 8

938
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:18,431
Categorical variables which are either red or white

939
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:21,503
And we can look at the likelihood function

940
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:23,551
As a function of all of those

941
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:25,087
I'm going to imagine

942
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:25,855
Fat

943
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:29,695
Set of possible values of the land along

944
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:31,487
Eleven22

945
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:40,703
Which is k1 through Cayenne is living in a stack of pancakes

946
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:41,983
So

947
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:49,151
Every one of these pancakes has Atlanta won exatlon the two exits in this discrete pancakes for the number pancakes

948
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:50,175
2 to the power

949
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:50,943
And

950
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:56,575
The Boston pancake is the one that says that kawann

951
00:56:56,831 --> 00:57:01,951
2 km is

952
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:05,279
One of Thee

953
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:12,447
Exponential's and his the top of the pancake or just pay one through K and his old zeros and then

954
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:16,799
Instead of

955
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:19,103
Wanted to

956
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:23,199
And in between we have all the other possible labelings of the puns

957
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:29,087
Temporary hypothesis about what the labeling is and what lender 111 we can count

958
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:30,879
What the value of

959
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:33,951
Tee off

960
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:37,279
Given

961
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:38,815
Lambda

962
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:46,239
In fact we can work out the probability of X and quantities together

963
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:47,775
Right

964
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:49,055
Let's do that

965
00:57:58,271 --> 00:58:01,599
So here are some data points I'm going to repeat this exercise

966
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:03,903
The four different data sets

967
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:06,719
And what I'm going to do is show you

968
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:08,767
The inference of what we think

969
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:13,375
Lambda Lambda 2 and Chaos I'm going to show you the stack of pancakes

970
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:21,055
And I'm also going to run to the inference for the simple model that says that there is only one exponential

971
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:25,151
Go back to the T-Mobile one military the enforcement other one

972
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:32,831
What am I going to do I'm going to stop just by you doing the inferences from little warm again

973
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:35,647
And then we'll move on to doing more than one animal to

974
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:38,975
So here's our super simple dating site with just 4 points in it

975
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:42,559
Good function looks like as a function of Lambda

976
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:44,607
Or as a function of Lambda

977
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,655
So that's what we did in my with the guy

978
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:51,519
So I'm just showing you again on a slightly different style the things you familiar with

979
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:58,431
This is what you get if you take the maximum likelihood value of Lambda so you take a point estimate Lambda a new show

980
00:58:58,687 --> 00:59:01,759
Density in data space alongside those four points

981
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:02,783
All right

982
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:07,647
So I'm introducing you to the sequence of things I'll show you I'll show you the the data

983
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:10,719
I show you a likelihood function and then I show you

984
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:12,255
Best fit

985
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:15,839
Distribution the fit that maximizes the likelihood

986
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:22,751
And then just for the sake of argument I'll show you what might have happened if we had chosen some beans to put the plants in

987
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:27,103
And counted how many where they spend so this to Blue bins in a histogram

988
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:29,407
I'm rich maybe food for thought

989
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:31,199
I got his motivator

990
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:32,991
So

991
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:34,527
Penny datapoints also

992
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:35,807
And you can

993
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:37,599
What kind of like a function

994
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:41,183
Landers quite well determined

995
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:46,559
Its characteristic in this sort of problem that typically the width of the peak

996
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:48,863
Shrinks as the square root

997
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:52,447
Drink has one of his Square each of the the number of data points youth golf

998
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:54,495
That's a useful rule of thumb

999
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:56,287
To have for this one problem

1000
00:59:57,055 --> 01:00:00,895
And that is the best fishing

1001
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:10,111
That's the Green Cove that maximizes the likelihood for the model that says there is only one Lambda

1002
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:17,023
But if you have very careful eyes and the skeptical mindset you might look at this clumping

1003
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:19,839
Appoint elections items I need to sure about that

1004
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:25,215
So you might be a skeptic about the warm Lambda hypothesis

1005
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:26,495
That's what

1006
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:28,799
The date it looks like if you shove it into Benz

1007
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:35,455
Where to buy just invented

1008
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:42,367
Data inventions

1009
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:44,671
Not that we had about Benz

1010
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:46,207
But just to remind you

1011
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:48,255
Methods that when not using

1012
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:53,631
Okay let's move on today step number three of slightly reduce the amount of data because I want to to the end

1013
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:54,655
3 manageable

1014
01:00:54,911 --> 01:01:01,055
Talk of the dataset hair that I've deliberately chosen to have size eight points so Tuesday is 250

1015
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:07,455
256 hypotheses about how the point we're actually colored in red and white before the colors were there

1016
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:09,247
Raised to make a mold blue

1017
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:14,879
So that's how we're going to fit model one in the same way as before

1018
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:16,927
And we're also going to look at Model T

1019
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:19,487
So here's the likelihood function from other one

1020
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:21,791
Showing it as a function Lambda

1021
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:24,095
And here it is I was going to Laughlin.

1022
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:26,911
And that is the best fit

1023
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:30,751
Green card for best single exponential

1024
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:32,799
You got by maximizing likelihood

1025
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:34,591
No

1026
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:38,943
That's the histogram using a particular bin size

1027
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:45,855
Just a few interesting things now what we're doing is going to Rattle through the pancakes so the 256 of them

1028
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:48,159
Shuffle down to Pancake number 7

1029
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:54,303
The labeling that k12k and is in buying Ray station on cake

1030
01:01:54,559 --> 01:02:00,703
And the likelihood function that any particular labeling K is beautifully simple because if you nuke a

1031
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:04,287
Then you would know that the last three days but I told him from lime to two

1032
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:07,103
And the first 5.0 came from the wall

1033
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:13,503
And the likelihood function probability as a function of Lambda one

1034
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:20,159
It's just the simple function that we had the full form of the metal one and the likelihood as much 11 to 2

1035
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:22,207
Is it the same function

1036
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:26,303
We had against a little Wang if you know which points go with which

1037
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:28,863
Pasta is which exponential

1038
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:35,775
So this is a super simple thing it's just a product of two of the two functions that we are already familiar with

1039
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:37,567
When we are dealing with more than one

1040
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:44,223
I love you through the pancake. Blob is a simple separable function just moves around because

1041
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:50,623
Different wavelengths put the put the best gas alarm to 1 alarm to 2 in different places the finals

1042
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:51,647
Back of the pancake

1043
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:58,047
The final layer is one that says that rule from Lambda Wang in fact

1044
01:02:58,303 --> 01:02:59,839
Is the way round of Godly

1045
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:04,191
The old ones hypothesis

1046
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:09,311
Says they will be long till I'm the one which means land one is quite well determined don't have a clue about number two

1047
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:10,847
Because

1048
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:13,407
None of the bike that came from the second cluster

1049
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:15,199
Okay so some of the pancake

1050
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:17,759
Suffolk walks

1051
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:23,135
Look I'm like this and many of them look like the globe and they're all in different locations

1052
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:30,303
Blah blah blah blah blah blah

1053
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:35,679
I'm this one iPad will be a just the same rotated 90 degrees

1054
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:42,847
What can we do with all this information that we've accumulated we've run through a total number of hypotheses

1055
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:46,943
Twitching of 256 times the number of points I looked at

1056
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:53,599
Any I take the number of points that was such as you * 32 * 1.2 never take so I've come

1057
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:54,367
Imputed

1058
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:59,743
256000 numbers have switch off every one of those subtype policies

1059
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:06,143
Go to 56000 Suffolk place where every one of those how we did that

1060
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:07,935
Predict the day that she happened

1061
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:12,543
When we know that we can then read anything we're interested in for example

1062
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:14,079
We can read that

1063
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:20,479
How probable alternative you got that essentially by summing all of the time

1064
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:22,015
Pancakes on top of each other

1065
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:27,135
That's what I look like

1066
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:34,559
Sorry to bumps.on what that saying is yes this data which someone with a keen I might have thought

1067
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:42,239
It's almost may have thought that there's evidence for to exponential's in that

1068
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:44,543
The most benefit to the state about giving yourself

1069
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:46,335
2 kilometers

1070
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:50,431
And what that says about looks like with pretty colors is showing

1071
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:52,479
What it looks like is a contour plot

1072
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:53,503
As a function of

1073
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:59,903
Landa Wonderland the two distinct bumps saying yes you can either fix slime

1074
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:03,231
And the ones with small value and longitude value or vice versa

1075
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:09,631
And those are by far more probable than other values of London Wonderland the two for example that that equal to

1076
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:11,167
Which would lie along

1077
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:13,471
Diagonal

1078
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:19,871
We can also ask the question what's the poster distribution of the labels what we think all the khazar

1079
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:26,271
And this 256 hypotheses and this is the sum is essentially the sum of every

1080
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:27,039
Nothing in the pancake

1081
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:28,831
All right

1082
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:31,391
And

1083
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:33,183
He has some that up

1084
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:34,207
And

1085
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:40,863
You find the different labeling labeling

1086
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:43,423
Labelings which correspond to one

1087
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:49,823
Purple Simon Reds and whites and the other opposite assignment symmetry about the middle because the

1088
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:55,199
The binary representation type of property that if you take one labeling in your voice or the ones and zeros

1089
01:05:55,455 --> 01:06:01,599
You switch between integers that sum to 255 so that's why it looks white is that nursing

1090
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:02,367
Symmetry

1091
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:07,231
Okay so we can read out if we're interested in

1092
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:12,095
The maximum likelihood value of philando 111

1093
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:13,887
And that's shown hair

1094
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:18,495
And the purple line showing one of the exponential's

1095
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:23,615
And the gray line is showing the other exponential and the green line is the

1096
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:27,199
Some of those those two exponentials

1097
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:29,759
And

1098
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:33,087
The green light is on top of the grey line NYC

1099
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:34,623
Let me see a little bit of the Gray Line

1100
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:37,695
Okay so that's the maximum likelihood

1101
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:39,743
Hypothesis using two Lambos

1102
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:41,791
Then

1103
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:47,935
We can repeat this for another day to sat and what I wanted to show you before we do that

1104
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:49,727
Is let's

1105
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:53,823
Answer the final question the model comparison question you compare the models

1106
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:55,103
By summing up

1107
01:06:55,359 --> 01:07:01,247
I'm getting the normalizing constant and the code I just ran as a rent through these examples

1108
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:02,271
Did that

1109
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:05,087
Unfold is 30%

1110
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:07,391
This is what happened

1111
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:11,999
V Wong

1112
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:13,535
Is this consultation

1113
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:16,607
Have been tense

1114
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:19,679
Formula 1

1115
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:21,215
Is that guy

1116
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:27,359
Is this guy

1117
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:32,479
Providence long came out 5.4 x 6 - 7

1118
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:34,527
What what is predicting

1119
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:38,367
A problem with a probability density overnight dimensional space

1120
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:44,767
Weathers 8 data points will be so it's not surprising have an extremely small number for the evidence because

1121
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:46,815
Predicting in a

1122
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:48,095
Elijah space

1123
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:51,167
A real valued

1124
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:53,215
Atrial bankruptcies

1125
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:55,775
Evidence number 2

1126
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:58,591
I want to talk about comes to 1.4 * 20 - 5

1127
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:05,759
And what that means is the evidence ratio which is what you need if you want to know the probability ratio but

1128
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:07,295
These two

1129
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:11,903
Number to evidence ratio is 26 to 1

1130
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:18,303
20 blackout that evidence ratio I did need to make an assumption about what the prior online the walls and I've gone the Forgotten

1131
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:20,607
What primer on laminate I actually chose

1132
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:27,007
But it was uniform overload Lambda in some range I forgot from from Walter boxer

1133
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:29,823
Four orders of magnitude or something like that

1134
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:34,687
These answers do depend on that prior but nothing is super sensitive way

1135
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:42,367
Obviously I have to depend on your assumptions but you shouldn't worry about that particular assumption be a terrible

1136
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:44,927
ISO game-breaker

1137
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:51,839
If it is a game-breaker you can find out you can explore the sensitivity of the answers to these questions

1138
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:56,447
To those assumptions if you're worried about whether you thought happen enough about your assumptions

1139
01:08:56,703 --> 01:09:00,543
This particular

1140
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:06,431
Prince takes too long in favor of mobile to so if they had equal prior probabilities

1141
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:12,831
You got a stator and you end up saying it's 96% to 4% also in favor of

1142
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:13,855
Little Texas

1143
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:15,647
No

1144
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:19,231
The final thing to emphasize is that it didn't have to come out that way

1145
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:24,351
There are many ways on fishing models for example if someone doesn't maximum likelihood fish

1146
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:29,471
How do you say I know how do I tell which model best will let's pick them up with the biggest blanket

1147
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:31,007
If you do that

1148
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:37,407
Belinda always choosing mobile to because trivially mobile 2 with an extra parameters can achieve a better

1149
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:39,199
A bigger likelihood

1150
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:44,831
But that isn't a Bayesian model comparison the books

1151
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:51,231
It involves doing this summation nude with your compassion based on the normalizing constant so we don't look at what was

1152
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:53,791
We looked at what state

1153
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:59,935
Aggregate of how well you predicted the data coming over all the possible values for your hypotheses

1154
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:03,519
That is not necessarily the case that mold to will always win

1155
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:04,543
Indeed

1156
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:08,639
They're all dataset switch model one wins and that's the final thing I'll now show you

1157
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:09,663
So

1158
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:11,199
The spinal dataset

1159
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:13,247
Sharon hair

1160
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:16,575
Is it ice that that really did come from a single exponential

1161
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:19,135
I drew eight points from an exponential

1162
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:25,535
If we go with the likelihood function fit model 1 unlock Style

1163
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:26,559
Vince

1164
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:30,911
And then we do model 2 and we run through all the pancakes

1165
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:35,775
It looks just the same as before to a casual Observer

1166
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:38,079
Have these bumps wobbling around as we

1167
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:40,383
Run through the 256 assignments

1168
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:41,663
And now

1169
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:43,199
When we say What's the

1170
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:45,503
Majin likelihood of laminate 1 alarm to 2

1171
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:47,807
You find it's actually

1172
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:49,855
It looks fairly

1173
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:52,671
Uni Moodle it's not exactly in the middle

1174
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:58,559
If you make a contour plot and if you go into the zoom into the peak of this and look super super super carefully

1175
01:10:58,815 --> 01:11:00,095
Beyonce's on the screen now

1176
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:01,119
We could do that

1177
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:02,143
You actually find

1178
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:05,471
That you can get a slightly bigger likelihood

1179
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:06,751
Bye

1180
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:11,615
Having learned one very very similar to each other

1181
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:16,991
All right so that's the likelihood of number 1 and number 2

1182
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:23,647
And this is the posterior distribution of the labels just as last time some labelings are more probable than others

1183
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:27,487
And we can work out the evidence ratio

1184
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:31,839
And the answer for the evidence ratio is shown

1185
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:35,679
It's .27

1186
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:42,079
The other way so now the more probable model in this case hair is Mortal woman comes out

1187
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:45,919
78% to 22% if they equally probable

1188
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:47,199
In the beginning

1189
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:54,879
So that is how mullican person works and what I take away from this is

1190
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:56,927
Given that

1191
01:11:57,183 --> 01:12:03,327
Standard ways of fishing even model with just one parameter can run. Plagens problems unless you use Bayes theorem

1192
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:06,399
I find it quite a compelling

1193
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:12,799
Argument for saying yes let's use Bayes theorem

1194
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:19,199
Running around that was an introduction to inference of promises and multiple

1195
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:22,015
What we going to do next

1196
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:23,039
Time

1197
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:25,087
Is

1198
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:28,927
We will move on to the topic of clustering

1199
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:30,975
I'll discuss

1200
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:37,375
Some quite popular algorithms for doing clustering which can be used for things like

1201
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:46,847
Maybe I kind of recognition and speech recognition problems has an example from speech

1202
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:53,247
You could take a single word utterance and take its spectrogram and the Olio

1203
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:54,527
Objects on the left

1204
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:55,807
Of the top

1205
01:12:56,063 --> 01:13:00,927
Are people saying the wood Witch is it one of those long and one of them 0

1206
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:03,743
Israel

1207
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:11,679
I guess the right angles of the zeros and then you train up on all of those training examples

1208
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:17,311
Someone gives you some more words to recognize which they are and you could imagine that

1209
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:21,407
Yeah so the ones on the left in the zeros on the right

1210
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:28,063
So we'll talk about clustering and I'll describe a popular method to doing clustering then we'll give it a Bayesian interpretation and

1211
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:30,879
Discuss how to make it a better using

1212
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:31,903
Top Beijing

1213
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:33,183
Interpretation

1214
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:35,231
So that's the first thing we'll do next time

1215
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:37,279
Are there any questions

1216
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:42,399
Okay thanks very much

1217
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:51,359
Okay the question is have Bayesian methods not being used frequently because I computer intensive

1218
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:55,455
I think that's not really then it suddenly makes it easier

1219
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:58,527
To use Bayesian methods if you brought the computer

1220
01:13:58,783 --> 01:14:03,391
But I think it's a strange accident of History really because

1221
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:04,671
It's perfectly possible

1222
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:07,487
Take a problem like this when we did hair

1223
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:14,399
I with a single exponential it's respectful to work out a lot to the function and sketch it's by where I do

1224
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:17,215
A method that we didn't need a computer to do it

1225
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:20,031
And

1226
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:27,199
So I think it is more an accident of some personalities and political fights between academic

1227
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:33,087
That these other schools doing things otherwise I grew up

1228
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:34,367
And

1229
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:41,535
But it does this urge to have a circle the projective method labeled subjective

1230
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:44,607
Can people deluded themselves into thinking booties other methods

1231
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:47,423
Would actually a subjective as well

1232
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:49,215
So

1233
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:55,359
Having computers definitely makes its rightful to use off of Bayesian methods and what we're going to discuss

1234
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:57,151
A whole bunch of ways of

1235
01:14:57,407 --> 01:15:00,223
Doing practical Bayesian methods on computers

1236
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:03,551
But way back before computers Raven.

1237
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:07,391
The earliest work on inference

1238
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:09,695
With that being done by LaPlace

1239
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:11,231
LaPlace

1240
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:17,631
The correct name for Bayes theorem instantly it is with my sister because I used it in anger on real data

1241
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:19,423
Update on the obit

1242
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:21,727
And the way things to be inferred and he used

1243
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:25,311
They start to do those inferences

1244
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:29,919
He knew that it was the right way to do things and

1245
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:34,015
That was the birth of of Bayesian inference

1246
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:37,855
So it's not for like a computers

1247
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:41,439
